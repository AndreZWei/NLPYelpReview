No worries though because I've written you a handy list of pro tips to enjoy Marche; \n\n1) Avoid office lunch rush hours. If you want to go from 12 - 1:30 then you're committing to a very chaotic experience\n\n2) If you're in an indecisive mood just skip marche for that day (i.e. it took you more than 2 minutes to pick out your outfit in the morning)\n\n3) Try their rosti - it's a classic!\n\nMy personal favourite is their green curry but just explore and enjoy!!!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

I understand no outside liquids, but when I went to the bar to ask for water, they said (alcoholic) drinks were free, but they only had bottled water, and you had to pay for it.  Only in a Las Vegas nightclub would they charge for water when it's 100 degrees outside.  Alcohol dehydrates you.  The least they could do is give me a cup of water from the tap with my alcohol, especially if I'm staying there a while.\n\nI guess I'm not a fan of nightclubs, anyway, because I value my hearing, but it was very crowded, and I hate it when people don't move when you ask.  I definitely physically pushed people out of my way, and got pushed by other people.  I went to the balcony to try and spot my friends on the dance floor below, and the people standing there literally pushed me back so they could stand there and talk and not let me even see.  Welcome to Las Vegas.\n\nAs I was going in and out of the club, there are so many different lines, and you literally feel like you're being herded like cattle.  The staff is not paid to be friendly, I suppose, but only one of the staff members I interacted with had any notable personality (actually it was the guy who asked me to dump out my water, and he was friendly and funny about it, which is why I obliged so easily).

The openness of the lounge's setup makes it easy for people strolling by to get a look at who's playing, and there's a pretty good amount of seating room.  The dance floor is small, but the coolness of this place comes from how much history has taken place there.  It's one of the very small number of lounges that is pretty much original from the age of Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin.  Just, don't ask the bar to make you a mojito.  I made that mistake, and they gave me something that tasted like chocolate-mint flavored awfulness.  Other than that, feel free to check out no-cover shows taking place there Tuesday through Saturday nights, starting at 10 pm.

I did ask KEVAN about this customization and he did not approve such a thing.  We are a franchise and unfortunately NOT allowed this.  I agree with you!  Mango&Passion is NOT a WACKY drink.  Alas the higher powers that be do not allow this.  In fact NEVER.  Trouble has been issued to us for such WACKY concoctions.  Silly?  I concur.\n\nI do hope you re-consider your review about this matter.  We really can't do it.  Your disdainful rating will have to stay with us.  You can hate us, be long gone with us, and be happy at Starbucks.  We try our best and if we messed up your drink.. Sorry again.  \n\nYou can go to the other Kung Fu Tea... They will get in trouble.  In fact you just got them in trouble.  No stamp cards there either.  I think YOU should question them about it.  Not us.\n\nDominic\n************UPDATE\/RESPONSE*** 9\/20\/2016**********************\nThank you for your reply.\n\nWho are you suggesting I question, and about what?\n\nAs a point of clarification, in the past Kevan made these drinks for us himself. It wasn't necessarily a matter of needing his approval?... regardless, I completely understand now that it was not something he \"should\" have been doing and that you are bounded by rules.... rules that do not reflect amazing customer experiences.\n\nDominic I'd be more than happy to give your store the 5 stars it deserves, but you too are missing the big picture. You FAIL to acknowledge it in your reply as well. You failed to show us how much you CARE about our needs as the customer. You expressed understanding about our frustrations... BUT as the OWNER you offered NO further solutions... as simple as\n\n \"I will continue to submit requests the to the powers that be for this alteration as I understand this change will make many of my customers happy.\" \n\nYOU are the person in the best position to express this need and push for the changes to occur. BUT you mentioned nothing of the sort. I'm a little disappointed.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Today I had the worst customer experience of my life. I asked the cashier \"When you have a moment could you please come wipe out table down its kind of sticky\" the place was dead and he wasn't occupied but he never came. Ok I thought no worries. Our food was delivered to us by another gentlemen by the name of Daniel. I asked Daniel \"Could you wipe the table down for us when you get a chance\" he replied \"sure\". As he walked away with his back turned to he says \"a please would be appreciated \" in a completely passive aggressive tone. He's right I should have said please but that doesn't change the fact that he was being completely unprofessional. When he came back I proceeded to address the situation as he comment made me feel really uncomfortable. I told him hey I don't appreciate being spoken to In such an aggressive manner. He then proceeded to argue and escalate the situation in a completely immature way. Cherry on top when our argument concluded he followed it up with \"cool story bro\" that really got my blood boiling. I'm not one to complain but I felt the need to get a manager involved at this point. Their employee had disrespected me and was being completely unprofessional. When I spoke to them they mocked and asked me what they should do \"sit him down and give him a stern talking to\" with a huge grin on their face. They essentially blew me off and expect me to believe that will address the situation with the runner? Yea, I don't think so. It wasn't until another runner came out from the kitchen and acknowledged the situation and explained that Daniel can be a bit of a dick. It isn't my fault that's he's a dick or is having a bad day. They shouldn't take it out on their customer and if he can't deal with customers then he shouldn't be working in the customer service industry. I can honestly say that I will not be returning to chicken shack not after the complete disregard they showed for customer satisfaction.","useful":6,"funny":1,"cool":0}

The service is decent, not great, but decent. \n\nOn my two visits, I ordered the Pad Thai noodles with pot sticker dim sum and Hor Fun with Satay Chicken. Being a Thai food aficionado, there was something a bit odd about the Pad Thai, almost a sickly sweet taste to it. The pot stickers were not exceptionally noteworthy. The Hor Fun was the best dish I ordered. The Satay Chicken was good, but it's pretty hard to screw that dish up.\n\nI applaud them for giving correct portion sizes. They do not dump a truckload of food on a plate. It's a respectable serving size without making you feel like a glutton for finishing your bowl. The service was a bit sketchy. Not awful, but not great. My waitress just had the attitude of \"what do you want to eat,\" not \"can I answer any questions you might have?\" \n\nOverpriced, yes. Underwhelming, no.

That's a shame, because my experience was fantastic.\n\nWe had a 6:45pm reservation (made months in advance) and had to wait 30 minutes when we arrived. The manager personally came out to apologize to us and offered us drinks and dessert on the house for the entire evening. I've been to plenty of places where they sort of shaft you on the amount of alcohol - not here. I ordered a Jack & Coke with a lime wedge to start off with and the bartender, on his own, made it with Gentleman Jack and it was stiff to say the least. Nice crushed ice served in a very unique high ball glass. All night long, they made sure that a fresh high ball glass of our drinks were following as soon as one was empty. \n\nWith what I thought was a proper handling of the table situation, we waited for our table to open, sipping drinks and admiring the scenery. Once seated, we ordered the Port Judith Calimari and the seared yellowfin tuna for starters. Both were outstanding. I'm a harsh judge of calimari and Emeril's did not disappoint. Still not the best I've ever had, but definitely up there. I ordered the pecan crusted Texas redfish, pepper jack potato rosti, creole meuniere sauce and grilled vegetable ratatouille. It was absolutely delicious. The smash across the face you received from the melody of flavors was incredible. I don't recall what my friend ordered but he was raving about it.\n\nFor dessert, we were told by our waitress if there is one dessert you must try, it is Emeril's Banana Cream Pie. Words fail to describe how delicious and filling this was. It was served in a nice warm cast iron skillet, with gorgeous chocolate shavings nestled on top.  \n\nThe service: top notch. Our waitress was prompt, courteous, full of recommendations and explanations of flavors on each dish, and never far from us. Zero complaints. I never once had to ask for anything - it just appeared. \n\nThe interior décor: well thought out, with a nice earth tone color scheme which is accentuated by a wide variety of brilliant sapphire blues, yellows, purples, reds, and silvers at the bar and around the restaurant. It has a very trendy, but authentic New Orleans flare to it. The bar at the center has a nice feel to it, with nicely back lit liquor shelves to showcase Emeril's offerings. There is a ridiculous amount of wine racks all around the exterior of the restaurant, giving patrons quite the selection from which to choose.\n\nThe price: frankly, I thought the prices on the menu were fair for the caliber of restaurant such as Emeril's in a city like Vegas. My entrée was $28, and when I got the bill, much to my surprise, the manager had also comped our appetizers. So all we ended up paying for was our entrées. Really, that is going above and beyond to correct a mistake.\n\nThe manager paid us a visit once at the end of our meal to ask how everything was, apologizing once again for the delay, and asking us if we would come back. The answer was a resounding yes. We thanked him for his hospitality and his drive to make our visit the best it could be.\n\nI am sure sorry if Emeril's at the MGM Grand has gone downhill since I visited a few years back. But I stand by my review. When I was there, they treated us incredibly well and made a faux pax on their part with our reservation right.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1}

I really needed to access some documents on my laptop waiting for my flight and was sitting at Appropos in the F gate area. When I asked the waitress why I can't get on the wi-fi, she responded that \"oh yeah this side of the airport doesn't get good wi-fi.\" What? Are you kidding me? You are at a major international airport for crying out loud and you can't provide even a basic wi-fi connection? I'm not asking for speed, I'm merely asking for a connection. The iPads at each area are a very classy touch, and the food\/drinks at the above mentioned restaurant by the gate were top notch. The gates themselves were deficient in seating area, so most passengers lined up to sit on the edge of the people mover.\n\nCustoms coming in to Toronto were amongst the nicest and easiest I've ever had to deal with - even giving service with a smile which is unheard of anywhere else. I guess  the Canadians live up to their pleasant and friendly stereotype, even at customs.

It's a pretty well laid out airport, and making connectors is pretty much a snap because of the super fast people movers that wisp you away to this and that gate area. \n\nI was there not too long ago and had an early morning 1.5 hour layover. Ate at a typical Tex-Mex place that served chorizo and scrambled eggs. Quite tasty and I like how they mix in plenty of restaurants around the gate areas. \n\nIt's a big and busy airport, but navigating it is very straight forward. If I'm heading out West, this is an airport that I don't mind hanging in if I have to have a layover. It features free wi-fi that seemed to work wherever I went. The airport and it's bathrooms are very clean and well maintained. \n\nA word to the wise: if you are running a low battery on your electronic devices, you're better off sitting down at a restaurant and trying to find a wall outlet to mooch power from than you are trying to find an available outlet at the gate area. They are few and far between at the gates and you can almost rest assured someone has beaten you to the punch in using it. So I usually go into a restaurant, scope out an outlet near a table or a booth, sit down and use that. Of course, just to be courteous, I'll order something to eat to make it fair. I haven't had to go through the TSA checkpoint since I only land there to connect elsewhere, so I can't comment on that fun experience.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1}

I love the blue sky and clouds mural on the ceilings and the light effects they do to mimic day light. The casino floor is nice, but I think Paris thinks a bit too highly of themselves because their table minimums were awfully high, and their poker tourneys were set at buy-ins that were so high that they were only filling half of the field.\n\nHowever, Paris does have one little thing that sets it apart from every other place on the Strip: their breakfast buffet. This breakfast spread they have, set in a Parisian village theme, is absolutely out of control. I have never in my life seen so many different options on a breakfast buffet. At $30\/person, it's steep, but it is an experience you'll never forget. In the \"you're not going to believe this just happened to me\" Vegas-story fashion, my buddy and I are standing in this incredibly long line waiting to pay our $30 each and these two incredibly cute girls walk out of the buffet area and headed over to us. They asked us if we'd like two free coupons for the buffet; of course we took them graciously and chatted for just a minute. They had to go to the airport and weren't going to be in town to use them. They informed us we didn't have to wait in line, we could just walk in -- and walk in we did. Certain things in life are just perpetual game-changers, and Paris' breakfast buffet is one of them.\n\nEverything you ever wanted or could dream of wanting for breakfast was there. Since that experience, it's been a tradition that every time I'm in town, I go to Paris for breakfast only. They can keep the gaming and sell that to the tourists. If I want to game, I'll go to the MGM, Rio, Caesars or the Bellagio. In fact, Paris could just close its casino as far as I'm concerned and keep the breakfast buffet open. This is also where my nickname \"Bullmoose\" originated, so it's been a great story to tell!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The casino is so huge that I still haven't seen all of the 170,000+ square feet of gaming area. MGM sort of bridges the gap between a great casino and a great resort. It ties both in with a proper attention given to both. You can find very reasonable rates per night there. It's conveniently located at the South end of the strip, so coming from McCarron International, your cab fees will be light. When you pull up to the MGM, you can just sense the rich history of this place. The epic pay-per-view boxing matches, the world-renowned shows, the great concerts, etc. When the sign says \"The City of Entertainment,\" you have no problem believing it. The lobby is a beautiful marble with the MGM lion front and center. It is a grand entrance, which is both breathtaking and elegant. \n\nFrom a gaming perspective, I love that the MGM connects both low rollers and high rollers and doesn't discriminate their table offerings based upon a crowd they're trying to attract, such as The Wynn, The Bellagio, or the Venetian. You can easily still find $5 blackjack tables there, and of course, the $100 tables are always available. The mid-range rooms are very nice. The beds are super comfortable, nice blackout curtains in the afternoon to block out that intense summer time sun. The bathrooms are spacious and luxuriously appointed. \n\nOf all the casinos I've visited, the dealers at the MGM have been by far the most cool, down-to-earth, fun, funny and engaged. The casino has many restaurants, including Emeril's, there are day spas, pool and beach area for the kids, and nice shops if that's your thing.\n\nI can't think of a better place if you've never been to Vegas and want the experience without laying down a boatload of cash to get it. I will always rotate MGM into my stays in Vegas. It was my first and will always hold a special place in my heart.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1}

From the moment we walked in, it was clear that this was a masterpiece of Las Vegas. The feel, the atmosphere, everything was first class. The hand blown glass tulips in the lobby are breathtaking. There is an air of classiness to this place that seems lacking in other casinos (not all of them) on the strip. Bellagio feels like it runs at a slower, more deliberate pace. The staff were first class and very professional. \n\nThe room itself made you want to stay and appreciate it. Everything from the fully stocked wet bar, to the view, to the absolutely gorgeous bathroom with steam shower and hot tub, to the most comfortable beds just made the Bellagio steal the show. The view of the strip is awesome. There is so much to do in the hotel\/casino that you could really just stay there; lots of high end shops, restaurants, salon & day spa, etc. can fill your day with activities.\n\nFortunately, I had been to Vegas twice prior to staying here so I could justify just hanging out and taking in as much as I could. Everything about the Bellagio is just dripping with elegance. I know that now, it is considered one of the \"older\" hotels on the strip, but that does not make it any less appealing. At night time, it is always an experience to go take in one of the fountain shows. \n\nYeah, it's pricey, but it's doable if you're visiting off-season and work your magic on the internet to book a room with them. The room service is flawless. \n\nOn the casino floor, they are very aggressive to make sure you have drinks while you are gaming and even if you are not. I came down the elevators early one morning around 5:45am to grab a newspaper and a coffee. A very attractive young waitress approached me as I walked out of and asked me if she could get me a drink. I told her I was just looking for some coffee and a newspaper. She told me she would go get me one and asked me if I would like Bailey's with it, to which I happily accepted. I wandered over and grabbed a newspaper, and she was waiting for me with not one, but two cups of coffee with lids on them.\n\nBellagio will always hold a special place in my heart. Great memories and I hope to be back one day. Without hesitation, 5 stars.","useful":5,"funny":0,"cool":0}

You walk into the place and it is dripping with elegance and very worthy of its 5 diamond rating. There's so much to do in this place that it is a vacation in and of itself. I think it's fitting that this place stands where the Sands used to stand. The Sands in its heyday was the height of class, and the Venetian proudly carries that torch.\n\nThey spent a tremendous amount of time, research, architectural detail, and of course money to make this place what it is. I've gamed there many times and what stood out to me was how nice and friendly everyone was, right down to the pit bosses. \n\nThe only thing that keeps me from staying there is that constant incense smell that is overpowering when you walk in. Yes, it smells nice, but it dries my eyes out and stuffs my nose up, so I've always defaulted to choosing the Bellagio over the Venetian. But I love visiting and just spending time looking around.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I can't bring my kid to the gaming area, this is why I need a place for her. I found at least 3 areas on my own, thanks for nothing... \n\nI got to my room, the cheese crumbs was still on the couch.

My husband had to call to ask them about it. \n\nWe ended up sleeping in a comforter that was wrapped with a fitted sheet, which means no comforter cover and no sheets. We got hot at night and realized there was no sheets... The next day I asked a house keeper is it normal they don't provide sheets for the bed. It turns out my room wasn't clean.

So many people who do not even live here park in our parking spots. DO NOT SIGN YOUR LEASE AT BOLERO!!!!!! I love giving great compliments but this apartment complex deserves none!!!!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The food was amazing.  My partner had the fried oysters w\/seaweed slaw.  Spectacular, especially the slaw.  I had the lobster bisque w\/flying fish roe.  Similarly tasty.\n3. The entres came and were greatly satisfying.  The Marlin had a nice lime aioli.  The pasta had a large portion of different shellfish that were quite delicious.  \n4.  Great selections from the desserts offered this week.  It was really hard to choose, and when ours arrived, they were great!\n5.  The only glitch was there was no decaf. to order with dessert, but we had enough wine & water to be satisfied.\n6.  The serving staff & the hosts were beyond professional.  This group worked together like a well-oiled machine.  Or maybe a well-tuned instrument.  \n\nA huge thanks to everyone who made this experience a bright spot in the middle of an otherwise dreary week in winter.  WE WILL RETURN!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

When in Kensington, I almost always go to Hibiscus, but decided to mix things up this time. A decision I definitely regret. Although Hibiacus has raised their prices slightly, it still would have been cheaper than this bowl from Urban Herbivore.\n\nThe staff at Urban Herbivore just added insult to injury. Both workers behind the counter were surley and did not look happy to be there at all.

He said that the box had been mislabelled and that the true price is the price that comes up when the box is scanned and this is the price that is set by head office. The manager said that since it was the price set by head office, there was nothing he could do about it. \n\nI was really unimpressed by this inflexibility.

There was a group of about 10 of us, and we had tried to get in a few weeks earlier around 10:15 at night and the line was ridiculous! As we were keen to go to Rock n Horses, we decided to make a reservation for dinner for my friend's celebration. The reservation was for 6:30, and we were told that we would need to finish our meals by 9 because they would need to move our table off of the dance floor since we were a big group. Rock n Horses certainly isn't busy early on in the night, but there are some definite advantages to arriving early:\n\n1) Free coat check (I believe before 9)\n2) No cover\n3) Guaranteed entry - no need to wait in slow moving lines!\n4) $15 bottles of wine on Fridays between 5 and 7 (warning: this is not good quality wine!)\n\nThe food is pretty good and presented well for a bar. However we were a bit disappointed to hear that they were already out of corn on the cob when we placed our orders at 7. \n\nI had the garlic prawns ($12 - white wine, chilli garlic butter, grilled bread) without the butter. I also made a last minute adjustment to my meal and asked to have a side salad instead of the grilled bread. The waitress was great and rushed to see if they could accommodate my request. Although this dish is listed as a starter, it could easily be a main as it comes with plenty of shrimp! The shrimp arrive in a small cast iron skillet on top of a wooden board and the salad came in a bowl to the side. The shrimp were well cooked and very flavourful, and the salad really exceeded my expectations! There were fresh mixed greens along with large pieces of fresh carrots, blanched green beans, cucumbers, and other quality vegetable toppings.\n\nOur server was great and easily managed our group and our complicated orders. The establishment also allowed us to bring in our own cupcakes for our friend's birthday; however, given the theme of the venue I was expecting a bit more in terms of 'presentation' when we asked for the cupcakes - a song or something would have been nice! One hiccough with the service was that we did not receive separate bills. Our server was able to ring us through on separate credit cards though.\n\nThe rest of the evening was pretty fun with a number of group members getting up for a ride on the mechanical bull! The music was your typical country tunes, with staff members providing line dancing 'lessons' early on in the evening. I didn't find that the venue ever got particularly busy or crowded, so there was never a long wait to be served at the bar. But with only three stalls in the ladies washroom, there was quite a line to get in.\n\nDefinitely a fun night in the end, but I'm not sure if this is a place I would go to regularly.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

He replaced it with a new one  for about $50+tax and everything was working perfectly for about two weeks (one week ago from this review). Up until this point I was definitely giving a 5 star rating! \n\nThen my phone randomly turned off on itself. I turned it back on and then a few minutes later it was off again. I turned it back on, and it seemed fine, so I just left it. Then a few days later it happened again, but this time it continuously was turning itself right back off again. It reached about 70% power and it just completely turned off and would not restart. I plugged it in and then it seemed to be fine (I should note - I was inside, and had been inside for quite some time - this becomes a bit more important later). The next day I decided to bring it back to the store to have it examined. On my walk to the store (I walked from Yonge and College to Yonge and Wellesley), it turned off, then back on again, then completely off. I was told that iPhones have a tendency to turn off in the cold weather... hmmm.. this never happened once to me in the previous 3 years that I've had this phone.. and it's been outside in temperatures much colder than the balmy 3 degree weather that day! I was a bit skeptical about being given this as an explanation. Then I was told that sometimes when they put in new batteries, you have to backup your phone and restore it to factory settings for your phone to properly recognize the new battery.

For starters, it arrived quite a bit longer after my other dishes and my friends' dishes - to the point that I had to ask the waitress if it was coming because I wasn't sure if they had forgotten about it or not. Once it arrived it was way too overcooked.

I have dined in, have ordered take out, and have ordered delivery without any issues and without compromising on food quality. It trumps the Greek restaurants on the Danforth where I find the food can often be too salty and oily.\n\nThe food is delicious and the customer service is great. My favourite dish is the village salad (big fresh chunks of peppers, cucumbers, onions, feta, and olives) topped with either grilled chicken, grilled calamari, or grilled shrimp. The grilled calamari is one of the best I have had, but you really can't go wrong with any of the three! The chicken souvlaki is also great. Even the small size is quite large, so if you order the regular size, be prepared to bring home leftovers! My friend ordered the Greek chicken wrap for take-out and it was massive - like two meals in one! I also really enjoy the complimentary grilled pita they give you as an appetizer topped with olive oil and garlic (they also provide this with all take out and delivery orders). It is especially yummy dipped in their hummus.\n\nIn addition to the quality of the food, the prices are fantastic! Especially given that within a five minute walk from the restaurant you will pay twice the price for half of the food. The owners and servers are very kind and more than willing to accommodate you and your dietary preferences (I don't like the olives or feta with my village salad).

We selected Windup Bird Cafe as they are able to cater to all of these dietary needs. \n\nThe restaurant is quite quaint with quirky decor - mismatched side plates, bright and vibrant paintings, etc.\n\nWe were greeted warmly, and although we had a reservation, it was not at all necessary as there were only about two other tables occupied, so we were told we could sit wherever we wanted. The server was very sweet and when she heard that it was our first time there, she was eager to tell us all about the concept of the place and the various events that are held there. \n\nI had items 1 and 2 as my main. Items 3 and 4 come with a small serving of the butternut squash soup and a very small tasting of each of the three salads in the 3-kind salad.\n\n1) 3-Kind Salad ($9 - baby arugula w\/micro-sprouts, mixed bean, & roasted Ontario beets - vegan and gluten-free)\nThis was a good dish. The beets could have been roasted slightly longer to become more tender and they could have been seasoned a bit better. \n\n2) Curried Butternut Squash Soup ($7)\nI was really looking forward to this dish as I had read some rave reviews on Yelp. It was a cold day so I was hoping for the soup to be pipping hot. It was definitely warm, but I would have liked it to be that temperature where you just have to give a gentle blow on the spoon before you have your first few sips. You could definitely taste the curry and the soup had a bit of a kick. There was definitely something added to the soup, and I'm not sure what it was (maybe potato?) that muted the flavour of the butternut squash, and I did not like this aspect of the dish. I did not like the bread that was served with the soup. It was more like crostini and it was rather crunchy. I would have preferred soft and fluffy bread that I could have dipped in my soup.\n\n3) Vegetable Keema Curry ($13 - Stewed celery, mushroom, chickpea, onion, carrot, sweet bell pepper - vegan and gluten-free)\nThis dish was served with brown rice and there were generous portions of both the rice and the curry. I had a taste of my friend's dish and you could definitely appreciate the flavours. There was a strong hint of cinnamon, so if you are averse to cinnamon, I would avoid this dish.\n\n4) Open-Faced Grilled Chicken Breast Sandwich ($16) \nThis was a chicken breast that was sliced (and appeared to be sprinkled with cinnamon, among other seasonings) served alongside 3 large pieces of bread. The pickled vegetables that the menu's describes consisted of about four small spears of vegetables. There was also a balsamic glaze on the plate as well as three small side dishes of spreads for your sandwich (butter, grainy Dijon, and a red sauce that looked to be spicy). \n\nThe prices were a bit steep for a lunch, but you get a decent amount of food, so it's not bad. However; for a similar soup and salad combo, I would go to the nearby Hibiscus on Augusta Ave for, in my opinion, a much better squash soup and more flavourful salad bowl for about half the price of the soup and salad here.\n\nOur waitress came by after we paid and asked if we wanted some complimentary freshly squeezed juice. She offered us orange, apple, cranberry, or strawberry-basil. We decided to try the strawberry-basil and the cranberry. The strawberry-basil was quite nice and refreshing, and it was the juice we all preferred. The cranberry was fine, but it does not taste like typical cranberry juice. It smelled a bit odd and was not tart or sour like I was expecting when you eat fresh cranberries. Upon asking the waitress about this further, she explained that they do not actually make the juices there, but rather purchase them from another company, and that sweetener was added to the cranberry juice.\n\nI would likely return to this restaurant again, although I will probably stick with Hibiscus as my go-to for a soup and salad combo in the area.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":2}

It would be easy to miss it.\n\nTwo of us arrived for dinner around 5:30 on a Sunday evening without a reservation. We were told the only seats available were at the bar, so we sat there.\n\nThe food was good, I will give it that. But there are very few vegetarian dishes, and they were not very accommodating. Here is what we ordered:\n\nScallop and crema - this is not at all what I was expecting. It was more like a scallop ceviche. It was a cold dish of chopped up scallop on top of crema. I asked if we could have it with the crema on the side and was immediately shot down. I really dislike when restaurants do this and do not accommodate for even slight adjustments to their menu. When the dish arrived, the scallop had literally been scooped on top of the crema, so it could easily have been prepared with the crema on the side.\n\nGreen tomatoes - this dish had dollops of chicken liver with tiny slices of fried green tomatoes on top, and then a bed of mixed greens placed on top of all of that. There was a good kick to the chicken liver, but I wouldn't order this dish again.\n\nShrimp and greens - about 5 pieces of grilled shrimp (cooked well) on top of a lot of buttery-oily sauce, with oily sautéed spinach on top. The shrimp were really yummy, but I found the spinach to be quite flavourless.\n\nMackerel - long thin piece of grilled mackerel on top of a salsa verde that was strongly flavoured with cilantro. I would avoid this dish if you don't like cilantro!!\n\nThe music was good here - a mix of Motown and indie stuff. Tip: they don't take American Express.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I came here with two friends for dinner on a Friday night. I wanted a reservation around 6 or 6:30, but they only had 5:30 available. \n\nThe ambiance and environment is really cool here. It's too bad that the restaurant doesn't have a patio as I'm sure the decor could have been really well done on one. I had the sense that the design was aiming for a rustic, run-down, side-of-the-road Mexican establishment, but with a hip and edgy vibe, and I would say they certain accomplished that feeling. As other reviews have mentioned, there are no paper menus. Their offerings are simply listed on chalkboards on the walls. I did not have an issues with reading the boards as I was sitting right in front of one and the restaurant was not too busy, but I could see how it would be a pain if you are ordering multiple rounds of food or drinks (which is how they recommend ordering) to have to constantly remember what each dish contains. The washrooms are clean, but I only saw a single room for ladies and a single room for men, so I imagine that there can be a line up at times, especially later in the night.\n\nDishes we ordered:\n\n1) Guacamole and chips - my friends were disappointed that it did not come in a mortar bowl (how it is served at Playa Cabana) because it gave the sense that it was not quite as fresh. Apparently the guac does have a slight kick to it.\n\n2) Fried quaso chihuahua - my friend likes this, but it was also a bit spicy. It is literally a block of fried cheese on a tortilla\n\n3) Kalbi beef taco - we were told that this would be little pieces of charred beef cooked medium-rare. We were all disappointed to see that the meat was definitely more cooked than medium-rare. It was more like medium-well.\n\n4) Baja fish taco - I asked for this to be grilled, not fried, and to have it without the aioli. The waitress was happy to oblige. It was a good dish and I really like the slaw that is served on top, but I thought that the fish was slightly undercooked and I found that the tortilla had gotten a bit soggy (possibly from the fish?) which made it hard to eat. Despite this I was happy to see that they were not stingy on the amount of fish that they provide!\n\n5) Grilled calamari with burnt arbol kimchi - the calamari was delicious, I would definitely recommend ordering it! I did not find that it came with a lot of kimchi, and do not order it thinking that it is like Korean kimchi, because it isn't.\n\n7) Jumbo shrimp taco - this really was a jumbo shrimp which is tempuraed, placed on a tortilla, and loaded with a bunch of toppings. My friend said it was rather spicy, but she really liked it.\n\nService - I am a bit torn about what to write about this. I had the opposite experience to what other reviews have mentioned. Our server was extremely pleasant and very engaging. She took the time to go through every dish and offering with great detail when we told her that we had not been to the restaurant before. I have a friend who is both vegan and sensitive to gluten (she was not with me on this visit) and so I am always on the look out for places that can cater to both carnivores and people with dietary restrictions. I asked the server about one of their dishes (the portobello fajitas) because it sounded like it could cater to my friend's needs. The waitress said it would fit the bill and she also suggested other dishes that can be adapted to fit my friend's needs. This aspect of service gets five stars! I called earlier in the day to see if it would be possible to change our reservation from 5:30 to 6 because 5:30 is a bit early for dinner. I was told that this would not be possible because there were other groups coming in at 7, and that the restaurant tends to get busy around then. When we arrived at the restaurant at 5:30, we weren't too hungry so we thought we would just enjoy some drinks and guac with chips while we figured out what to eat. I got the sense that they wanted us to move along and order our food because they didn't want us to take up the table for too long. When we left at 7:20, I was surprised to see that the restaurant was only about 60-70% full. As a result, it was disappointing that we were felt a bit rushed earlier on in the meal. We also did not ask for our bill, it was simply placed on our table when we had finished our plates and we were not given the chance to ask for separate bills (although our sever was happy to enter individual amounts when we paid).\n\nOverall I had a good time at Barrio Correano, but I do not feel any real urgency to rush back. I would go if other people wanted to try it out. It won't be a staple in my restaurant repertoire.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

When I was younger, I would eagerly count down the days until My Favourite opened.\n\nFor the past few years now, I would say that I have been continuously less impressed. While their product offering had remained the same (Greg's ice cream, create-you-own frozen yoghurt with the choice of two flavours, and a random assortment of Popsicles and frozen treats), their prices have definitely gone up, to the point that it might be more worthwhile to take a walk on a lovely summer's day \/ night to one of the Yorkville establishments. However, I would recommend the mint chip ice cream without hesitation! It is not the sickly fake green colour that is commonly found in mint chocolate chip ice creams, and it has a refreshing minty taste with real tasting chocolate chips.\n\nAs previous reviewers have mentioned, service can be unpredictable. Sometimes you have a really nice server and sometimes it seems as if they couldn't care less whether or not you buy their product.\n\nI also have to comment on the great name - My Favourite!

We were welcomed immediately and brought to one of the few remaining tables. As soon as we sat down we were given complimentary green tea, salad, and miso soup. We had not even opened the menus yet! So far they were starting off very well.\n\nI ordered the shrimp sashimi ($8 - four pieces) and the cucumber roll ($3 - eight pieces). After ordering, we enjoyed our appetizers and both commented on how much we like our salads. Although it was the standard iceberg lettuce that you tend to get at Japanese restaurants, the dressing was different and was really good! Neither of us had the miso soup as we just do not enjoy it in general. \n\nOur main dishes arrived quickly and we both commented on the size of the rolls - we were not expecting to receive eight pieces - and eight pieces that were stuffed well with a good rice to filling ratio! I like that they brought all four of our dishes at the same time (my friend's two rolls and my sashimi and cucumber roll); however, it was a bit odd that they split up our two orders and put one if each of our orders on two different plates. As in my shrimp was plated with one of my friend's rolls and my cucumber roll was plated with her other roll. My shrimp sashimi was very fresh and were good sized pieces. \n\nThe service was also very good and the wait staff were pleasant. WOW Sushi loses half of a star because I thought that $8 for four pieces of shrimp sashimi was a bit steep. They do have lunch specials, so the prices may not be as bad if you order one of those.\n\nAll in all this was a good experience and I will return.

I was really excited to try Catch because I love seafood and it came highly recommended by a friend.\n\nThe restaurant wasn't too busy when we arrived, but it filled up pretty quickly. It is a small establishment, so if you are keen to go then you may want a reservation. As other reviewers have mentioned, the restaurant becomes extremely noisy and it is very difficult to hear your companions speak. I am a young person and had to ask my friends to repeat themselves on numerous occasions. The decor is pretty basic although they do have interesting serving plates. I also liked how there is a very open kitchen (look to your left when you enter) so you can see everything the chefs are doing.\n\nService was satisfactory. There was a bus boy and it seemed like his only job was to clear plates and fill water glasses. Our glasses were never empty, but he always seemed to be at our table. This could be fixed if they used bigger water glasses!\n\nThere were a few things that irritated me about our service that made me feel like the waitress was trying to increase the size of our bill:\n\n1) My friend and I wanted to share a glass of white wine and she clearly explained this to the waitress and asked her to bring a second empty glass. When our waitress came back, she returned with two rather full looking glasses of wine. When we asked if that was one glass that had been split in half, she said she had thought we ordered two glasses of wine.\n\n2) When asked about dish recommendations, she always suggested the more expensive of two options. This happened twice to me, so it seemed a bit suspicious.\n\n3) As other reviewers had mentioned, the waitress recommended a pound of fish per person if you go for \"the big catch\". But, there were no fish that were 1 pound, the smallest was 1.5 pounds. You also hVe to be careful because the prices of the fish are not indicated on the specials chalkboard and you have to ask for them. Prices ranged from about $50 to over $80.\n\nThe reason why this restaurant gets three stars rather than two is because of the food. Three of us ordered:\n\n1) Gazpacho ($10) - this was the worst dish of the meal. It was a gazpacho soup with seafood garnish. (1 shrimp, 2 very small scallops, a hunk of white fish, and a few rings of calamari). The calamari was extremely chewy and I personally found it to be inedible. The flavour of the gazpacho base was decent and had a bit if a kick, but I found it to be rather salty and disgustingly oily such that I couldn't finish it. I would never order this dish again... and it came recommended from our waitress. \n\n2) Tuna Cesar salad ($11) - this was a decent portion and my friend liked it.\n\n3) Clams linguine ($19) - another good sized portion and my friend finished it off, so I think he enjoyed it! It was a bit odd that they did not give him a spoon for the linguine or a side plate for his empty shells and he had to ask for both.\n\n4) Sea diver scallops with a sweet pea purée and a bacon garnish ($29) - my friend loved this dish and said she would definitely order it again. I tried a bite of one of her scallops and would have to agree that they were quite well cooked.\n\n5) Roasted halibut with a zucchini leek side ($30) - this came with two good sized fillets of halibut. The fish was cooked perfectly. The zucchini leek side consisted primarily of olives and capers, and I did not find much zucchini or leek. Might would order this again if I came back to the restaurant.\n\n6) Sautéed kale and spinach with roasted garlic ($5) - my friend ordered this as a side to her scallops. I had a bite and I thought that the greens were fine, but rather flavourless. I wouldn't order this dish again, but would try a different side instead. \n\nThe scallops and the halibut were what elevated the restaurant from two stars to three. There are many other interesting restaurants in the area, and new ones are constantly opening. I wouldn't go back to Catch just for the halibut and the scallops. Overall I was disappointed with my experience.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The decor is relatively modern, although it is starting to look a bit tired and shabby. Most of the chairs were starting to show quite a bit of wear on the fabric armrests and you could see that there was chipped paint on a number of their cabinets. \n\nThe servers were pleasant and unobtrusive, but I got the sense that they did not exactly go out of their way to cater to the diners. Spoons were dropped, water refills could have been more frequent, etc.\n\nFor drinks we just had a coffee and a tea during lunch, and a cappuccino at the end of the meal. Both the coffee and tea arrived with small cookies on the saucer, but the cappuccino did not come with one. It was surprising to me that the green tea came with a biscuit while a cappuccino did not as you would be more likely to expect one with the cappuccino. The cappuccino also took an extremely long time to arrive. The server actually had to go back to check on it because it was so slow to arrive. We were joking that they must be milking their own cows and growing their own beans! I will note that the coffee and tea were both served as pots of coffee and pots of tea, which was appreciated.\n\nWe ordered two smoked salmon salads and a small lobster salad without the coconut.\n\nThe lobster salad was a decent portion and came with a small lobster-filled samosa. The flavour of the samosa filling was yummy, but the shell was overcooked and rather greasy. The salad is dressed in a very light vinaigrette and comes with some drops of aioli on the plate. I did not like the aioli and would have preferred the dish without it. There are also whole peppercorns pre-sprinkled over top of the salad, so be cautious if you are sensitive to pepper!\n\nThe smoked salmon salads were also enjoyed and they came with a bit of caviar sprinkled throughout as well as some large crisps of some sort on top. A lot of frisée is used, so if you don't like frisée, you may want to avoid this dish. One of my dining companions noted that they thought the salad could use a bit more dressing.\n\nThe bathrooms are a bit odd. They are located in the basement and are not wheelchair accessible. If you require wheelchair accessible washrooms, you have to take the elevator up a floor. Once inside the washroom, there are individual stalls with floor-to-ceiling doors and walls. The stalls themselves are quite dim, and I expected a light to come on automatically (I thought they might be motion-sensored), but both my dining companions had the same experience (in both the men's and ladies washrooms).\n\nOverall the experience was adequate, but I would not rush back to dbar. There are many other restaurants in the area where you would receive better good and service at the same price point.","useful":6,"funny":0,"cool":3}

There is a distinctly 'fishy' odor at the back of the store where they sell the fresh fish, but it's not even a normal fish-stall smell... it's not like when you pass the fresh fish stands at St. Lawrence Market. I did not find that the prices here were considerably better than nearby Sobeys or Metro, so I would definitely not return just to save money. Something else that was off-putting was the fact that they charge you $0.50 to use credit cards if you spend less than $30.

I would recommend making reservations before you arrive - you don't want to disappoint your Thai craving if you are faced with a wait!\n\nOne bonus of Sukho Thai is that it does take reservations and has incredibly similar (if not identical) dishes to Khao San Road (as they used to be owned by the same people) which does not take reservations and you may encounter a two hour wait for a table there!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

That wasn't a problem, as it was a nice night and we sat on a bench outside and perused the menus. Shortly after being seated (just after getting our water glasses filled and before placing our drink order), the hostess popped by and said, \"Just to let you know, we need your table for a reservation at 8:30.\" .... ummm excuse me?! We just sat down, and you expect us to finish our meal in an hour?! So I guess we're just going to be rushed through are food and shouldn't expect to be able to order an appetizer, main, and dessert, if we want?! Clearly we were not too pleased with this statement. When one of the waiters passed our table we asked if we could be moved to a different table that we would not be required to vacate in an hour and that was away from the windows (tip: you can feel a draft by the windows, so wouldn't want to sit near them in the winter). This waiter went off to check for us. Then a different waiter appeared to take our drink order and we explained our request. At this point, someone (who I assume was one of the managers) stuck his head in and briskly told us that things were taken care of and we would not have to leave by 8:30. Great! We were finally able to enjoy our evening. A further note on the service - after the initial rocky start to our meal, it would have been nice if the manager had checked in on us again later to make sure we were enjoying ourselves, but alas, that did not occur.\n\nDecor: refined casual - think gold framed pictures, accents of pastel colours, and a certain feminine flare to the room. It's definitely more elegant in appearance than Khao San Road, Sukho Thai, Pai, or Sabai Sabai.\n\nFood: matching the decor, also more refined than any of the chef's other restaurants. I wanted to order a tea to drink, but they didn't have any hot water yet... weird. Rather than make this statement for every dish, I'm just going to say outright that I think the dishes are overpriced. Yes, they are unique, but I thought everything was overpriced considering the serving size (except the mussels). We ordered:\n\n1) Mun Tawt Ruammit ($9) - taro root, sweet potato, and zucchini chips sprinkled with Tom yum spices. Personally I didn't taste much of the Tom yum and actually found them to be quite salty. \n\n2) Pad Buab Jae ($10) - Sliced gourd with garlic and basil. I really enjoyed this dish. There are many layers to the flavour of this dish with a strong smokey element. We both agreed that we would have preferred it had the gourd been crunchy or crispy. \n\n3) Hoi Nung Ta Krai ($14) - Roasted mussels with lemongrass broth. Phenomenal. So delicious and most definitely worth the price! And the way it is served is just gorgeous! This was by far my favourite dish. I just kept going back for more!\n\n4) Khao Yum ($24) - this is essentially a flavoured rice dish. Yes, it's gorgeous and includes some interesting components (pomelo, kaffir lime, and fried chili to list a few), but it's maybe one and a half cups of rice total and maybe 1-2 tbsp of each seasoning. I'm glad I ordered it once for the photo, but I wouldn't order it again. The waiter was right though - the photo does turn out better with flash!\n\n\n5) Dessert ($15) - they only had one dessert option on the night that we went, and it was a fruit platter. This consisted of two wedges of pomelo, four lychees, two mangosteens, and about 1\/4 of a mango. The pomelo was so fresh and delicious, but I'm biased because pomelo is quite possibly my favourite fruit and it has been out of season for awhile, so I'm always happy to get some. Save your money on dessert and grab something special elsewhere.\n\nAlthough overpriced, I will still return because the food was yummy, and I hope they have the kinks (in the service and the hot water) worked out by then!","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":2}

The beets were delicious, perfectly cooked - not too hard or too mushy. The beans \/ grains dish has a bit of an Indian curry flavour to it, so caution if you don't like that taste. I personally didn't like the kale hummus. I found it to be too bitter tasting, but my dining companion really liked it. I ordered the mixed greens salad and some of the Baby greens were wilty. The pasta was a quite a large serving. More than enough to take home leftovers and have a full meal the next day.\n\nThere isn't much ambiance to this place. It kind of looks like an old run down bar that they've converted into a restaurant. On the plus side, they do accept American Express! \n\nThey have lots of options for people with all sorts of tastes and the menu is well labeled with dietary options for any type of diet. Another word of advice - the menu in house is slightly different than the one online. It's not drastically different, but I'm sure if you saw something online that wasn't on the actual menu, then you could probably ask to see if they would make it for you","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

We arrived around noon and the restaurant was about 50% full. I started to notice that it got pretty busy with the lunch crowd around 12:30, so unless you're planning on doing take out, it might be a good idea to arrive a bit earlier so you can grab a table.\n\nOur cashier was a bit clueless. My friend asked if they had cheddar cheese available as all she wanted was cheese slices on toast. The cashier said that they did have cheddar cheese, but said she needed to ask how to ring in the order. We found this a bit odd because it clearly says on their menu that options include bread for $1 and cheese for $2. So wouldn't cheese and toast qualify as those two options? Our cashier asked another server and the server indicated that they did not actually have cheddar cheese. Then it took our server three attempts to accurately confirm our order - at one point she actually thought that we had also ordered an avocado sandwich.\n\nThey have an extensive menu with a number of healthy options available. I really liked how there are lots of combos to choose from and lots of ways to customize your meal. We both selected the red lentil soup, which was one of their two soups of the day (the other was butternut squash). The soup is just over $5 and comes with two halves of bread (choice of white, whole wheat, and multigrain) and little container of packaged butter on the side. The soup was quite good; however, it was rather chunky as the lentils are barely (if at all) puréed. I prefer my lentil soups to be smoother, but this is a matter of personal preference. I noticed that there were other vegetables in the soup too like carrots, onions, and tomatoes. It was also noted that the soup is vegan. We both ordered whole wheat bread and the slices were very thick and fluffy. It was clear that the bread was fresh!\n\nThe restaurant is clean and service is quick.

None of us had ever been before and we decided to try it out for a change from our usual sushi restaurants.\n\nThe restaurant is quite large. It is clean, spacious, modern, and dimly lit. They have both an AYCE menu (I believe around $19-20) as well as an a la carte option. We decided to order a la carte as we were a small group and not particularly hungry. The menu also has a number of unique rolls and dishes that you would not necessarily find at typical sushi bars. I ordered the following dishes:\n\n1) Fushimi Salad ($3.5 - assorted seafood, cucumber, green onion, with homemade sauce) - the only seafood I found was bits if calamari, and it was only small pieces of tentacles, not the nice smooth pieces if the squid's body. Given that the menu said 'assorted seafood' I was also hoping for some shrimp or crabmeat, but alas, did not have any. The dressing had a bit of a kick to it, was rather salty, and there was just too much dressing - the cucumbers were drenched! I wouldn't order this dish again.\n\n2) Shrimp Asparagus ($5 - cooked shrimp and asparagus with yuzu miso sauce) - this was four pieces of shrimp settled upon four spears of cooked asparagus. I would order this dish again and it was my favourite of the night.\n\n3) Eggplant Roll ($4, 4 pieces - eggplant, lettuce, cucumber, with house sauce) - warning: the eggplant is tempura eggplant! I wish the menu had said this as I do not like tempura and would not have ordered this dish had I known. Nevertheless, I had one piece.\n\n4) Cucumber Roll - because I did not like the eggplant roll, I decided to order a standard cucumber roll as it was a dish where I knew I would not be surprised with tempura again! It was a typical cucumber roll, although I found that there was too much rice (same with the eggplant roll).\n\nMy friends also enjoyed the dishes that they had ordered. The serving sizes are quite generous here and everything is presented artfully. A dish of wasabi and ginger was brought to the table before we had even ordered. I didn't particularly like this as it meant that these items were not freshly served, and these were communal dishes meant to be shared by everyone at the table.\n\nI am struggling with what to say regarding the service. Our server was very sweet and brought water to the table immediately. Although green tea was complimentary, you had to ask for it, and it was served in typical coffee mugs, not the little green tea cups. There were definitely some language issues with our server as she was not able to explain what was in the fushimi salad and I had asked for the house sauce on my eggplant roll to come on the side, but when she brought it to the table, she explained that she had forgotten and asked if I wanted a new roll. It was hard to turn down the roll once it had already come to the table. In addition I was surprised that she didn't ask about the fact that I had only eaten one of the four pieces of the eggplant roll. It would have been appreciated if she had asked and realized that I did not like the dish and then removed it from the bill. \n\nAlthough there were a few snags in my meal, this is a restaurant I would come back to in order to try some of their other dishes.\n\nSome additional notes:\n1) They don't accept American Express\n2) The bathrooms are co-ed - it's a series of single stalls with shared sinks and the stalls' doors are made of frosted glass.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

You have to go inside to serve yourself at the bar. The servers were pretty clueless. I asked for a glass of their chardonnay and the guy didn't know whether or not they had any. He didn't even check the bar without saying that, and the wine fridge was right behind him. I then wanted to pay for my glass of wine with Visa. This actually probably took around 10 minutes to process, and at the end of it all it turned out that they can't take the combined Visa-debit cards so be forewarned about that! I ended up paying in cash. I paid $15 ($8 for my wine and $7 for my friend's beer. I gave them a $20 and they gave me a $5 bill - which is fair enough, but it made it hard for me to tip them! \n\nThe inside is clean and relatively well maintained.

We know that Fresh can get busy and does not take reservations, so we decided to come earlier as opposed to later. When we arrived the restaurant was about 80% occupied and there were still a number of tables available. Despite this, the hostess said it would be a few minutes wait and she took our names. We were a bit confused because there were clearly empty tables available for parties of two. Nevertheless we were seated about a minute later.\n\nThis restaurant is jam packed.

Certainly not an ideal place for groups, and better suited to tables of 2-4 diners. They have a partially open kitchen so the four seats at the bar overlook the chefs. As a result, or possibly due to the building itself, the ventilation is very poor here causing the room to be really warm - to the point that they had to open to front door to cool things down. This meant that we had to fluctuate between asking for the door to be opened and closed throughout our meal.\n\nThe servers are definitely still learning the menu \/ the lay of the restaurant. I started as the first person to make my order and after I ordered two dishes, the server stopped me to describe what an appropriate amount of food was for our table for four and what she would suggest. Really, this should have happened when we were all initially seated and before we started to peruse the menu. The first dish I ordered was from the \"small\" section and it was a plate of cinnamon roasted beets with preserved lemon. When I asked for it, she remarked the the dish was a lot of beets! Our table laughed when we received the plate because in actuality it was quite small and it would be easy enough for someone to eat on their own. You could really taste the cinnamon and I did not detect the preserved lemon. Also, although not described on the menu, it comes on top of a layer of yogurt \/ cream - just in case you don't eat dairy (I don't). Another dish we ordered was the eggplant dip. I didn't particularly like it. It was more like a macerated bruschetta with bits of eggplant too (the tomato flavour came out more though) and a Seasoning that I did not particularly like. For $10, it was a tiny portion which I thought was overpriced. \n\nOriginally, we ordered two tagines, two of the \"small\" dishes, and three of the \"sides\" (steamed carrot salad with raisins, couscous, and horchata - a fried buttery biscuit).

Je suis donc passé au repas principal. Un chow mein cantonais. J'ai même demandé au monsieur par téléphone si c'était avec des nouilles aux oeufs croustillantes. Normalement, il y a des légumes variés pis des nouilles croustillants. Les seuls légumes qu'il y avait c'était la sorte de laitue asiatique et des brocolis. Pour la viande, c'était des crevettes qui goutaient le congelée et du poulet qui goûtait le poulet bouilli... Et les nouille,ceux que j'ai reussi a trouver au fond, cacher par cette montagne de laitue, étaient blanches et molles. On dirait que c'était un restant que quelques chose, ils ont laver les nouilles et les ont mis dans mon plat.\n\nBref, plus jamais de delices pour moi.

J'ai mangé un tartare de boeuf et mon ami le fish and chip. Le tartare de boeuf était bien, par contre les frites étaient froides et  très peu de vinaigrette sur la salade, comme s'ils avait oublié de mettre de l'huile et que du citron dessus, mais très peu.

Il est de 11h à 21h. Il y a un spécial sur un verre de bière à 3$ entre 11h et 14h (on aime ça!).  Le menu est quand même  très variés (la journée  où  j'ai été). Et il y a un plat qui se nomme \" En cas que..\"... En cas que je ne sais pas pourquoi...mais bref cette journée là c'était  des quesadillas au steak avec crème  sûre  et salsa on the side. J'ai pris la salade comme entrée. Une salade très abondante avec sûrement  de la sauce Style italienne de kraft...mais étonnamment  bonne.  Les quesadillas...wow!! Je ne sais pas quel type il a pris son steak mais c'était tendre!! Il était en plus saignant. Les quarts de quesadilla étaient très garni  et les frites  wow délicieuses. Et en passant la porte de la cuisine était ouverte  quand on est rentré..et le tout à d'l'air très propre! Comme désert, il y avait un gâteau  très  simple à la vanille, mais délicieux avec du nutella fondu sur le dessus...moi qui n'aime pas le sucré!! Attention je vous dévoile le prix de ses trois services. ......RRRRRRROULEMENT DE TAMBOURS!!! UN GROS 10.75$ tseeee..non mais à ce prix là j'aimerai  y aller tous les jours...mais je garde ma dignité..ça reste  quand même  un bar de danseuses et je ne suis pas la clientèle  cible. Ah btw, il y a un menu fast food...avec hamburger..pogo.. poutine...ailes de poulet...etc....etc qui reste  là tous les jours.\n\nBon après  vous avoir commenté de nourriture, parlons de l'endroit! Je suis rentré  avec mon ami (qui en passant a été quand même  souvent en soirée, mais qu'il n'a jamais mangé là). Il y avait le doorman, le monsieur  a demandé  un prix d'entrée\/pourboire à notre discrétion...Je lui ai donné 10$...et mon ami m'a ensuite dit...normalement tu donne 2$ en plus il nous à même  pas amener  à notre table etc etc...bref...je vais le savoir la prochaine fois!\n\nL'endroit est sombre  pour me midi...mais on s'entend ça reste un club de danseuses. Il doit y avoir beaucoup  plus d'ambiance durant le soir ça c'est sûre ! Les danseuses étaient ok...selon moi un peu plate ...mais bon  c'est  le midi....Mais elles  étaient belles! Le service est  très  rapide, la serveuse  de  l'alcool et de la nourriture  sont très  gentilles  et on bien répondu  à nos questions. En étant la seule femme comme cliente pendant que j'ai été, je ne me suis aucunement  senti jugée  ou même  pas à ma place. Que ce soit par le staff ou par la clientèle.\n\nBREF...GENS OUVERT D'ESPRIT  ET QUI AIMENT DE LA NOURRITURE  PAS CHER...JE VOUS LE RECOMMANDE!","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":0}

La grosse pancarte sur la 40 qui annonçait le spécial 2 pour 22 avait attiré mon attention. Alors, cherchant une place pas cher pour manger, nous avons décidé d'aller là-bas...ERREUR. Premièrement, je sais que ce n'est pas la faute au resto mais il est quand même difficile de trouver l'endroit en auto. Ce n'est pas trop bien expliqué. \nBref, nous rentrons là, le resto à quelques clients...genre une quinzaine. L'hôte hyper amicale nous a placer sur une banquette. Alors, je regarde le menu de pauvre, 2 pour 22, et bien il n'était pas trop attrayant.\n\n Et il y avait les autres plats....les fruits de mer avec pâtes m'attrayait. Et mon amie a décidé de me suivre, mais avec la table d'hôte. Elle a pris un tartare au saumon et moi les pâtes aux fruits de mer. Le serveur a amené la soupe de mon amie. Quelques minutes plus tard, le serveur est venu me demandé si c'est bel et bien les pâtes avec fruits de mer et non celui de crevettes, pétoncles et champignon. Je reconfirme mon plat de fruits de mer. En attendant nos plats, on a demandé du pain...c'était des petites baguettes...dûr au bout, mais chaude et moelleuse au milieu. Alors on reçoit nos plats. La lumière est très tamisé, alors je ne voyais pas bien le plat et j'avais faim. Après que j'ai mis du parmesan fourni par le serveur  et poivre moulu de tavle(le serveur nous a pas dit s'il y avait du poivre frais), je me rends compte que ce n'est pas le plat de fruit de mer...mais bien celui fe crevettes et champignons. J'y ai goutté..un peu trop de crème à mon goût et je voulais mes pâtes aux fruits de mer...alors obliger de dire au serveur et d'attendre une quinzaine de minutes pour qu'on me fasse le plat que j'ai demandé 2 fois...En attendant, je mangeais les frites de mon amie hehehe...elles étaient sec et dur.\n\nElle me dis que son saumon du tartare goûte bizarre. Je goûte et effectivement..un goût de poisson cuit avec du citron. Je regarde donc avec la lumière de mon cell et effectivement le saumon était rose cuit. Ça veut dire que le tartare n'était pas frais et à sûrement passé des heures mariné dans le citron...Le serveur a été mis au courant et a offert à mon amie si elle voulait autre chose ..le non a été sa réponse. \n\nVu qu'elle a pris la table d'hôte, elle avait le droit à un café. Le café arrive...et met le lait et elle ne dit..NONNN ok là ça ne va pas...UNE BOULE ÉTAIT FORMÉ DANS LE PETIT TRUC DE LAIT TELLEMENT QU'IL ÉTAIT VIEUX WASHHH.

Rendu chez une amie vers 3h du matin et sur Guy et St-Antoine, nous commencions à avoir faim. Et à part une pizzeria louche de Verdun, il n'y avait pas de resto ouvert pour la livraison. Il fallait donc se déplacer pour manger. Désolé je ne suis pas assez riche pour foodora ou ubereat... Et du Mcdo..et bien, j'en ai mangé 3 fois en 2 semaines..  Anyways\n\n C'est alors que Yelp m'a aidé à trouver un resto à proximité et ouvert....Le Boustan était le choix judicieux! Nous nous sommes donc aventurer sur la rue des très jeunes  soupçons des sorties de clubs, qui chill encore à 3h40, car c'est sûrement leur première sortie avec Fake ID, je parle de la rue Crescent! Arrivé devant le fameux Boustan, il y en avait des petits jeunes souls avec leur spinner..et un line -up. Malgré le line-up, ça n'a pas pris de temps pour se faire servir! J'ai pris un classique\n..le trio sandwich poulet, avec patates! \n\nMalgré mon ancienne vie de débauche, qui incluait des fois la rue Crescent, je n'avais jamais essayé le Boustan de Crescent. J'avais été à celui de Rivière-des-Prairies, qui était ok..mais sans plus...tsé tout est bon en y ajoutant de l'ail ou presque...! Il y avait du monde qui me parlait du Boustan...que c'était donc ben bon et tout...mais bon je ne les comprenais pas...car à RdP comme je vous dit c'était ordinaire...\n\nBref, sur mes patates j'ai demandé Humus et sauce à l'ail. J'adore quand le gars derrière le comptoir prend la cuillère remplie de sauce et y va d'un élan pour que la sauce tombe adéquatement sur les patates! Quand j'ai goûter au sandwich..j'ai compris pourquoi les gens capotait autant!! Le sandwich est tout chaud tout croustillant! Le poulet est malade mental  et les patates wow! Bref, c'est sûre que je recommande le Boustan peut importe l'heure! J'ai bien hâte d'y retourner miam!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Pendant mon 7h passé aux urgences j'ai pu me promener un peu. J'étais malade des intestins, alors je n'ai pas pu trop goûter ce qu'il y avait dans le resto ou cafétéria mais j'ai pu voir de mes propres yeux et vous écrire mon avis. Il faut savoir aussi que l'hôpital est situé dans un secteur résidentiel, donc il n'y a pas grand chose aux alentours. Pour cette évaluation, je vais diviser les endroits visité dans l'hôpital. \n\nLES URGENCES: C'était la première fois que j'y allais à ses Urgences. Un peu compliqué de s'y retrouver dans le processus d'inscription et de triage. Premièrement, il faut prendre un numéro, comme dans le comptoir à charcuterie dans une épicerie. Ensuite, on passe au triage avec un gentil infirmier. Après, c'est l'inscription, avec une madame qui on dirait est toujours occupé avec son ordi. Cela peut prendre 10 minutes avant qu'elle se rend compte qu'il y a quelqu'un assis sur son bureau devant elle. Soyez chanceux, qu'une fois qu'on vous appelle, le docteur et l'infirmière font les tests très rapidement. Nous n'avons pas besoin d'attendre une autre heure pour voir le docteur dans la salle de consultation. Prévoyez un bon deux heures pour avoir les résultats d'examens.\n\nLE BISTRO DU REZ-DE-CHAUSSÉE: Il est propre, il sent bon. Il y a un beau menu du jour. Il y a quelques petits articles déjà préparer que nous pouvons acheter et c'est un mini dépanneur. Il y a une vingtaine de places assises. Le staff très gentil. J'ai été acheter un thé, un muffin et un café (pour ma maman). J'ai pu regarder le menu. Simple. Par contre un trio deux hot-dogs, frites et boisson à 10-12$, cela devient cher. En même temps, après avoir vu la cafétéria du bas, on préfère payer le prix. En plus, le bistro est ouvert pas mal toute la journée et ce jusqu'à 21h.\n\nLA CAFÉTÉRIA DU SOUS-SOL: Une vrai cafétéria douteuse d'hôpital. Ouf le menu du jour. Une soupe au légume avec hamburger. Ma mère a manger cela. Je n'ai jamais vu un burger aussi dégoûtant. Certes, le prix n'est pas cher. La station des condiments de burger fait peur et n'a pas l'air propre. De même que le cuisinier ou le monsieur du comptoir...mais bon je tiens à ne pas dire de méchanceté gratuite sur l'apparence. Mais un peu plus d'entousiasme au monsieur ne ferait pas de tord.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Des chers et des pas chers..en autant que je ne tombe pas malade. \n\nBref, j'étais invité pour un anniversaire au Kanda Sushi de St-Léonard. La fameuse chaine de restaurant  de All you can eat Sushi, dont je n'avais jamais été. Elle est situé aux abords du fameux Carrefour Langelier.\n\nMon intérêt d'aller là était plus ou moins élevé, par contre, quand on m'a annoncé que c'était un KANDA PLUS, ce qui voulait dire un APPORTEZ VOTRE VIN, j'ai commencé à m'en réjouir de plus en plus. \n\nDès que nous sommes arrivé, nous avions le choix de sushi et de mets variables dans des feuilles où nous devions cocher et choisir les quantité. Les serveurs sont venu nous voir plusieurs fois pour vérifié si nous avions des questions. Ils ont été très vite à nous servir de l'eau et nous amener des seaux pour les bouteilles de vino. Une fois la commande passé, les sushis sont arrivés extrêmement vite. Je ne sais pas s'ils étaient fait d'avance, mais ils étaient délicieux. Certes, ce n'est pas les plus \"on point\" mais un gros 7\/10 en général pour les différents maki que j'ai goûté. \n\nPour ce qui est de la bouffe, j'ai adoré la crevette tempura, calmars sel et poivre et le pad thai a été le plat favori de notre table. J'ai goûté le tartare, c'était bon, mais c'était plus des morceaux d'avocats avec par dessus du saumon frais avec un coulis d'huile de sésame et des grains de sésame. \n\nNous étions un des derniers groupes à quitter. Nous n'avons pas senti le sentiment de pression qu'il fallait quitter OPC. Bref, pour 40$ je suis resté satisfaite, et c'est sûre que j'y retourne. Personnel super amical et courtois, la rapidité du resto et la propreté sont un plus pour ce resto. Viva los sushis","useful":1,"funny":2,"cool":2}

Pour ceux qui ont peur de se faire voler les bottes, mes bottes  coûtent 400$ et je n'ai  pas eu peur de me les faire voler. Aussi,  si jamais vous êtes  dédaigneux  de porter des pantoufles, vous pouvez toujours  ne pas en porter ou bien apporter les vôtres. \n\nAlors le concept, payez pour le temps que vous restez. 3$\/h jusqu'à  un max de 9$ par jour. Sur place, du café , du thé, des biscuits, des pretzels, des bonbons etc etc. Il y a aussi une machine à expresso, latte, moca qui doit être  utilisé  par le staff seulement. On nous demande simplement de laver notre tasse par la suite. Un peu comme dans une auberge de jeunesse tse. Il y a plein de salles differentes et salon sur deux étages. Vous faites  comme chez vous, même  apportez votre lunch. Il y a un micro-onde  aussi.

La soupe, pour etre sincère était bonne, mais....on dirait que c'était un mélange de 5 soupes différentes...car je ne connais aucune mais aucune soupe dans laquelle on retrouve 5 pâtes différentes (je les ai compté). \n\nDésolé, j'étais avec ma boss, donc je n'osait pas prndre de photos à table. \n\nAhhh pis il y a aussi une autre table d'hôte pour toute la journée : o et bien  c'etait entre 16.95 @ 18.95,  c'était compris la soupe maison, plat principal, café et désert. \n\nBref, si jamais tu es dans le coin je te conseil ce petit resto. La clientèle etait plutôt 70 ans et plus par contre. Perso, même si j'ai mis 3* j'y retourne sans hésiter. Il faut ben que j'essaie les autres plats à 7.95$","useful":0,"funny":3,"cool":1}

I couldn't get it out of my head! So I went onto Yelp and typed in grilled cheese and this place came up as being open and not too far away. \n\nSo off we went to the Shops at Don Mills. I've never been to the Shops at Don Mills before, although I have heard of it many times. I'd be interested to come back sometime when stores are open, but in the meantime, into Joey we went. That sounded funny....\n\nAnyway, we ordered calamari appetizer and drinks (beer and a cocktail). The calamari itself was alright, but I really liked the asparagus on top and the aioli. \n\nProblems arose in terms of the drinks. The waiter recommended the bellini, but then it turned out that the slush machine was umm....slushing. I had to wait until after my meal came to get the bellini, but the waiter was very apologetic and gave regular updates to the progress. It wasn't a huge deal, but I can't help but take points off. When you are paying $60 for two peoples' dinner, you don't really have a choice, right??\n\nMy husband ordered a simple caesar salad, which was good, but basic...that's not their fault, that's just what caesars are. I liked the freshly grated parmesan cheese on top though. Better than the powdery stuff that comes from a jar.\n\nNow...my sandwich. I of course ordered their grilled cheese, but this is not any grilled cheese, it is a LOBSTER grilled cheese...oh yes....oh yes....\n\nThe bread was buttery and crispy, the cheese perfectly melted and most importantly, it did not overpower the lobster. You could taste the lobster, which was in big chunks in the sandwich. It was delicious. \n\nThe sandwich comes with a large helping of their \"skinny fries\", which are similar to McDonald's fries, but less salty, thank God! \n\nI NEED to have this grilled cheese again and this place is open late nightly, so good to keep in mind, next time I get a grilled cheese craving. The service is good, prices a little steep, but to be expected in the area. Next time I think I'll order the soup with the sandwich, because I feel like it will work more nicely together.

It's a small, little restaurant with sort of demented decor, but the food is excellent. \n\nI went with my sister and husband and we were sat down in the small space. Ethiopian is eaten with your hands, so I went to the bathroom to wash my hands. The bathroom is upstairs where there is another upper part of the restaurant and a small bar. \n\nThe bathroom was clean, although I did notice a cockroach trap in the corner. I want to specify that the washroom was perfectly clean and I never saw any bugs. It was mildly disconcerting, but you'd probably be hard pressed to find any restaurant in downtown without a stray roach SOMEWHERE kicking around in it. Let's just be real!\n\nAnyway, myself and my sister ordered a combo dish of a small portion of all of their veggie options, for two. My husband ordered their \"special\",which was a chicken dish, served with a whole, hard boiled egg.\n\nOur meals arrived and my sister and my meal, was served on a large platter, with spoonfuls of the various dishes all around and a small salad in the middle. Certain parts were better than others, but that's probably a personal preference and nothing was bad. Just good and GOODER (yeah, I KNOW it's not a word).\n\nThe prices were also extremely reasonable. The portions of injera (the flat bread you eat the food with) were large and we were given 2 pieces each. That's ALL you would need, but if you're REALLY hungry, the food is served on a large piece of it, so you can literally eat your plate. \n\nThose are the good things. Now onto the not so good things.\n\nThe service was a little lacking. We ordered their special coffee at the beginning of the meal, as requested in the menu, only to be told they were not serving it anymore that day. We were there at around 8:30 and the restaurant closes at 11pm, according to their website. Why was it no longer being served??\n\nOur waitress seemed sort of displeased with us being there in general. She was not very friendly. She avoided eye contact with us most of the night, which made it really hard to get her attention to get the bill and to pay. \n\nMy sister and I were sitting across from each other and when our food was served our injera was on one plate. I asked if I could have another plate, to put my injera on and I got the dirtiest look you could imagine and the waitress turned on her heel without a word. She did get us a plate though. \n\nNormally, this type of service would be a real turn-off, but honestly the food was so damn good and the prices so damn good, I'm not even going to let it deter me! \n\nI WILL be back Ethiopian House Waitress!

YumTum\/ Toronto Underground Market is a food fair. You have to pay a cover and then you have access to various \"vendors\/chefs\" selling food for reasonable prices. So where is the problem? The problem is that it's not a reasonable cost. \n\nOnline the cost is now $22.60\/person PLUS a $2.50 service charge (WTF??!?). So basically you're looking at about $50 for two people...since you're probably not going alone.\n\nOnce in, each serving (depending on what it is, costs around $4-$5 on average). You're probably going to want to eat more than two things, since you're there, but lets say you're being cheap and you eat $10 worth of food. Now, for two people, you have spent $70....on a sampling of food, which may be good, but better be dipped in gold for that cost!\n\nOther accounts tell me that this place is sort of turning into another Taste of the Danforth...which used to be awesome...and now it SO crowded, it's totally not enjoyable. So be prepared to wait in lines. \n\nThis event sounds like it has turned into a total racket. Someone is racking in the dough. I would LOVE to support local food vendors and chefs, but it won't be like this. If it was $20 and you got tickets towards vendors of your choice (got to choose 4 samples, for example), or was cheaper, it would make more sense to me. This doesn't feel like it's supporting chefs anymore though. Feels like a money-grab.\n\nLet's see what else...parking is hard to come by...according to Yum Tum's website and so they provide a shuttle bus that runs EVERY THIRTY MINUTES! \n\nFor $70+ I can go and get a nice, sit down dinner with my husband...parking outside the door and that's what I'll be doing this Saturday.

Both shows I saw were quite good. Avenue Q was a funny, good time and Rocky Horror was EXCELLENT beyond words. Such a blast. \n\nBut I'll keep this review about the actual theatre. People with \"perfect pitch\" below are complaining about the mic problems and I hate to admit that she is not only humble, but correct in this case. There was one small mic problem that last for a couple of seconds in Rocky. \n\nThat said, this is a smaller-scale community theatre, not Mirvish productions. They have small, but passionate casts, performing larger than life productions. Sadly, once and awhile someone's voice gets a little pitchy, or a mic goes out. Since SOME people have such perfect voices, I DO hope they audition for future performances, because if you have perfect pitch, you should really be sharing your gift with the world. *ahem*\n\nWhere was I?\n\nRIGHT, the actual THEATRE.\n\nReally, I wish I could be giving this theatre a 3-1\/2 star rating.  The pros - There are no bad seats in the whole place!  Both times I have gone I have had what many people would consider the worst seats in the house. Once right in the front and once right in the back (corner no less).  When you have seats in the front, you are basically ON the stage. The actors come and interact with you and it's tonnes of fun. In the back you can see EVERYTHING and the peoples' reactions. Both seats were good. BUT the physical seats themselves leave something to be desired. THey are literally metal, folding chairs with patio furniture cushions on them. They are set on wooden risers and are very close together with narrow walking paths. \n\nThe other major problem are their bathrooms. I've obviously only seen the women's washroom though. The women's washroom has one two stalls in it, both of which are VERY small. Once you have to squeeze by an old, gross standing shower (?) to get to. The shower's sliding doors are only mostly closed, revealing garbage that has been piled up there...not like food garbage, but old pieces of crap, boxes and stuff. \n\nStaff have all be helpful and polite when we have gone and it's old and rickety, but works. That said, I feel like a lot of these people performing are local actors\/musicians, just trying to make it, or break into the business and so if the money goes to them, instead of fixing the theatre up a bit, I can understand that.\n\nNeither time I went, did those chairs, or bathrooms take away from the great time I had. Go with a light heart and an open-mind and you will have an excellent time.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0}

We wanted Lobretto Pizza, but the girl on the phone there said that at 6:30 we wouldn't have a problem getting a table and that turned out to be a lie, so we popped in a couple doors down to this place.\n\nWe glanced at the menu and it seemed alright, so we went for it. The host warned us that we needed to like meat and he was not kidding. Everything on the menu had meat.\n\nThe menu consists of a lot of pub faire, but at hugely inflated prices. The atmosphere, unlike what you would expect from a \"tavern\" was not dark and cozy, but white and as my friend described \"sort of like a 1950s bathroom\". It had white tile walls and white floors and a sort of mirrored panel across the walls...so yeah a bit bathroom-like. I guess to make it \"saintly\"? \n\nMy friend ordered their sandwich of the day, which was a BLT and fries. I have recently given up beef, which limited my choices considerably, so I got the fried chicken. I should mention that the menu includes exactly ZERO explanation of what any of the dishes are. The fried chicken simply says, \"fried chicken\". It did not explain that this came with mashed potatoes and sautéed spinach (or kale??) with it. Potatoes were good, but had big chunks of bacon in them. That should probably be mentioned, since if anyone doesn't eat pork, I don't think it would occur to them to ask the waiter(ess) if their fried chicken includes bacon. \n\nFood was alright. I liked my friend's sandwich better than my dish and her fries were good.  My meal was exactly as it said. No bells and whistles. I sort of felt like for $20 that chicken should have had some twist to it, or something special, but not really. It was chicken, much like you might receive from KFC, but marginally better (less greasy and salty). \n\nThe spinach was VERY salty tasting. \n\nService was good and everyone there was very nice. Overall it's a fine place, but nothing special and I think they charge too much for average food, with nothing special about it. Whenever I go back to the area, I'm going to try something else.

The lineup encouraged me that I was at a good place.\n\nService was fast and friendly. I got a cheeseburger and onion rings. They gave me a number and when I was called up, I chose what to put on my burger. \n\nNow, let's get down to the nitty gritty.\n\nFirst of all, the toppings are VERY limited. Onions or sautéed onions, pickles, tomato, ketchup, mayo, mustard, relish...I didn't even see lettuce, unless it was hiding in the back. \n\nThe burger was large, but nothing special. It wasn't like some fantastic, juicy, seasoned meat or anything. Just a basic burger. \n\nThe bun was too soft and got soggy really fast. I mean SOGGY! It had a weird sweetness to it that I wasn't a huge fan of. The onion rings were your basic frozen onion rings...same with the fries. They weren't hand-battered, or homemade...just standard fare. \n\nHonestly, NOTHING about this place warranted the rave reviews from my colleagues and the only thing I could glean from hearing them talk, was that this place has been around Scarborough forever and it's just a staple. You go here based on tradition. \n\nWell, sadly that's not enough of a reason for me to give this a good review. It's also not enough of a reason for me to bother recommending this place.

We also had soup, which was tomato and pretty basic. \n\nBoth of our sandwiches were good. I'd say my husband's was a little more sophisticated in taste. Mine felt like the pesto really overwhelmed any other flavours. It wasn't unpleasant, but I WAS wanting a grilled cheese. \n\nThe sandwiches are served in baskets, with some ripple chips and a slice of pickle...really good pickles actually. Chips are just chips. If these guys want to take things up a notch they should charge a dollar or two extra and consider creating a more interesting\/homemade side dish. What??! I don't know, I haven't thought that far ahead. People will pay extra for good and creative side dishes that really add to meals though, right??\n\nOh and in response to people who were commenting that the sandwiches are really greasy, I didn;t find that at all! There was no grease gathering at the bottom of the paper in the basket and my fingers stayed relatively clean! Maybe they changed??

I ordered a sandwich that's name I don't remember, but it was basically cheese, bacon and mushrooms. The to go sandwiches are in plastic boxes with lids. Great if you want to bring it to work the next day, or something.\n\nIn our case I split the sandwich in half and served it with my own soup the next day for dinner. This was definitely more of a traditional grilled cheese, but again, I found the bacon to be a little overpowering. Still good...my soup was heads and tails better though. \n\nNot sure I would bother with the soup here again. I liked everything I had, but nothing compared with the lobster grilled cheese I had the Joey's. The flavours were perfect in that sandwich!\n\nTHere are a lot of other options to try and everything was very good.

Although we came just as a torrential downpour occurred, which pushed us from the patio, to the bar to finish eating, the food and service were quite good and the prices reasonable (for Vegas standards). BUT, while we were there there was some sort of singer\/karaoke going on. I'm thinking a mixture of the two because we heard one girls' voice for several songs, but every once and awhile some obviously amateur's voice would ring out \"I'm too Sexy\" or a Spice Girl song.\nProblems: First of all, I did NOT sign up for karaoke. We sat AWAY from all of that to avoid it, but the problem was that they have speakers over all the tables, regardless of where you are and they were LOUD! Secondly, the woman singing, who, from what we could gauge over the speakers, worked here, was NOT a good singer. It was like listening to one of those American Idol auditions, where the person thinks they're great, but just sort of yells the song out and no one can be bothered to tell them they suck, because they're not nails on a chalkboard, but they're still not good either.\nSadly, we had to listen to this, even though we were in a totally different room!\nI WOULD go back, but not during karaoke!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I switched jobs and stopped working close by and didn't come back for years. I'm not kidding, I was always sad about that. It just wasn't close! \n\nWell, I happened to be in the area a few nights ago and of course, it only made sense to go back. It was exactly as I remembered it....AMAZING! The food is SO excellent here and the service is just amazingly quick. We got our food in I'd say under five minutes! Our water glasses were always full and the portions are so large, you can easily make one meal stretch to two. Just thinking about it right now makes me want to go back! \n\nSo why the loss of one star? \n\nWell...this is a tricky one. You see, the service was great, BUT there was probably one of the rudest and most annoying families I have ever encountered at a restaurant in my life...other than the time I was eating at a Kelsey's and a kid was literally running circles around the restaurant screaming and when I quietly asked the parents if they could quiet their child the dad told me to f-off, in front of his three year old...because they were celebrating a \"religious occasion\"....right, where was I? Yes, so this family was divided so that the approx 2 year old was sitting farthest away from all parents, in a booster seat and shouting and screeching loudly, while banging a spoon against the table. The other two yong boys, who appeared to be acting as the caregivers, where egging him on, trying to make him scream louder. The waiter took care of the spoon, by quietly taking away the metal one and replacing it with a plastic one, but the kid kept shouting.\n\nNow, I want to be clear. I don't blame the restaurant for bad parenting. I understand that this is a tricky situation. You don't want to single out any of your guests and lose business. But here's the thing. There were four adults there that you might lose business from, vs. the other 10-12 adults you very well could lose business from, because people were visibly upset with this kid and his parents. \n\nThe other thing is that there was an easy solution. Half of the restaurant, on the other side of the building, was not being used, simply because there were not enough patrons to require it. Having a waiter approach the family and politely offer them a table in that room, as it would allow their child to continue being a bit nosier, would both get rid of them AND probably show them that they need to control their terrible offspring. \n\nAs it was, nothing was resolved and we did not stick around for dessert. As we were leaving, a man sitting across from the family was looking like he might burst into flames. I asked if it was annoying enough for him and he shock his head and loudly said, \"I'm going to f-ing LOSE it.\" So yeah...may want to take care of that situation. Having your patrons enjoy their time is SO important to their experience. \n\nOH! And if you're a family with kids, everyone knows that kids make noise and can be rambunctious at times...it's still your job to ensure they are being polite. People managed to have their children be polite in public for hundreds of years. Surely it's not impossible in the year 2012. A good start would be to sit WITH them.","useful":3,"funny":4,"cool":3}

We went all out, so I'll go through the stuff I sampled.\n\nWe shared an arugula salad with walnuts and pears. Not a huge salad, given the $9 price tag, but was a really good salad. We also tried the ricotta gnocchi fritti. This was disappointing. They basically looked and tasted like tator tots with a sour cream and chive \"sauce\". I don't know where the ricotta comes into play, but these were nothing special, a small portion and not great in general. \n\nNOW for the reason people come to this place. The pizzas. I had the Libretto Margherita (which is $4 more than the regular margherita, presumably because they use buffalo mozzarella, or so it is alluded to on the menu). My husband got the house-made sausage pizza.\n\nThese pizzas were excellent. Both reminiscent of what you might find in Italy, very thin, but with perfect crust. I usually go with the margherita, because it's classic and not too many bells and whistles, but I had a piece of my husband's and it was excellent! I'm not usually a sausage fan (no pun intended), but this was really good. \n\nFinally, we split their sfingi, which is basically donut holes in cinnamon-sugar and with a strawberry sauce, caramel sauce or lemon sauce to dip them in. The donuts were nothing special. Honestly, I've had better at Tim Horton's. The sauces added a little something, but not enough to make this something I would order again. The lemon was good, husband liked the strawberry...the caramel, which you would think would be great with donuts, tasted burnt...to the point where it was inedible. \n\nSo basically, if you come for the pizza, you're good to go. This place does that really well..everything else...skip it. There are so many awesome little places in the area, I would just get the pizza and go get dessert somewhere else. \n\nThat said, because this place IS a pizzeria, I give it 4 stars, because they do the thing they're supposed to, well!","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0}

I did get my wedding hair and makeup done there though and was very happy. \n\nBut let's move onto NOW. Here's the thing: If you want quality, you MAY have to pay a bit more. Now that I've gone all over Toronto searching for a hair salon, I actually don't find Civello to be that expensive. I mean, consider that you are stuck wearing your hair every day of your life, right? If you had to wear the same pair of jeans every day for 3-4 months, would you buy the $40 pair, or the $200 pair? EXACTLY! Except it's really not crazy expensive and I don't know where I got that idea from exactly....\n\nOkay, so I'm getting off topic.\n\nI went to Civello the first time (since I got my hair styled three years ago for my wedding) at the beginning of the summer. Now there are LOTS of people that work at Civello, so I almost don't want to say who I went with, because I'm worried that everyone is going to start flocking to Civello and demanding this one stylist and I'll never be able to get an appointment ever again (yes, yes, #firstworldproblems).

They also give lovely back massages while your hair is setting. Or Byron was getting fresh. Who's to say?\n\nEveryone there is really lovely, but Byron may be one of the better hairdressers I have had. Conversation feels more natural and he has some sort of weird, superpower memory for people, which is both amazing and unsettling. Either way it makes conversation a pleasure. And of course he does hair well, which is why we go to hair salons at the end of the day.

We went with Priceline to get our hotel and were reasonably pleased with getting the Delta Centre-Ville as the hotel we ended up bidding on. It's a pretty good location and an okay price for a 3-1\/2 star hotel in Montreal (from what we were finding were normal prices). We paid around $125 a night, if I remember correctly. However, take into account that parking is around $25 extra per night, so really you're looking at $150\/night...so it's not cheap and I was expecting 3-1\/2 star quality. I did NOT get that.\n\nThe lobby looked pretty promising, clean and modern looking, but our room certainly doesn't look like any of those pictures you see on the travel sites. \n\nThe furniture was old and worn. The curtains were also worn and one had a hole in it that looked like it had been burned with a cigarette. The bathroom was very dated. The mirror was all that fake, gold brass, with lightbulbs that got really hot and there was no fan! There was also a single hook in the whole bathroom to hang towels on. Not even a towel holder, just one hook. The wallpaper was old and peeling in places. \n\nThe floor, where the door opened, was ripped and missing chunks. The bedding was old and dingy. There was TONNES of mold on the ceiling where the A\/C vent was. \n\nIn retrospect, we should have complained, but it wasn't so bad we couldn't sleep there, so we made due. \n\nAll this even would have been fine. I would have given it two, maybe even three stars (if I was feeling generous), except for what happened AFTER we checked out.\n\nMy sister had put the room on her credit card and she noticed a $100 charge from the hotel on her card when she got home. Since we had gone through Priceline, you pay in advance, so we had already paid for the room. She called up the hotel to ask about the strange charge. \n\nThe girl she spoke with told her that this was a sort of \"downpayment\" that they charge when you check in and assuming you don't make any charges, they reimburse you. So far fine, right? Except this was not explained politely. The girl was very rude and curt in explaining. No one had mentioned this when we checked in and my sister said so. The girl then told my sister that, \"If you ever travelled, then you would KNOW about this sort of thing, because EVERY hotel does it...Are you happy?\" \n\nMy sister was shocked by this response and just said yes and hung up. Then, regaining her bearings and realizing how rude the exchange had been, called back and asked to speak with a manager. She explained to the manager how she had been treated over the phone and the manager said she would speak to the girl. Obviously we have no idea if this happened, or how it was dealt with.\n\nThe fact is that 1) We actually travel quite a bit and NO actually Hotel Girl, other hotels do NOT charge you randomly, for no reason and 2) What if we didn't travel often?? How rude to throw it in our faces, as though this is something that any idiot should know, when it hadn't been explained. \n\nSo you know what....I can take the crappy room and old, dingy decor...but I can't take the hotel staff being blatantly rude and obnoxious.

Instead this place seems to specialize in sandwiches. \n\nThe gentleman who owns the place and makes the food was really the highlight of this place and would be the reason I would keep coming back. He is sweet and cheerful and kind and was quick to offer us samples to try. \n\nI ordered eggplant parmesan and my husband ordered a veal sandwich. Everything was fine, although nothing special. My husband ordered a caesar salad and the bacon bits were the sort of fake, packaged kind an the muchrooms for the sandwich were from a can. \n\nSo yes, this food IS made with love, because this gentleman who runs the place is lovely and has a true pride in his food. And the prices are extremely low. But it's still not the best quality and the taste suffers from it.\n\nTHAT said, you are not going to find such a large, veal sandwich for as cheap.\n\nFor these reasons I sort of equate this place to an Italian Subway sandwich shop. That's not a bad thing! The quality is on par with a fast food sandwich place and the prices are low. You know you ALL eat at Subway from time to time, when you just need a quick sandwich. So if you're in the area, I would check it out!","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Also you HAVE to go with a group. This isn't even something to do with a couple...although I did see it happening. \n\nI went with my loud, boisterous family\/friends. There were 8 of us in total. \n\nThe last time I went to Medieval Time was in grade 4, so what better time to go, than for your 30th birthday. We bought drinks in advance. Drink prices were average for a bar, although the mixed drinks were particularly delicious. The cups are kind of fun and you can keep them. The whole place reminded me of something you would find in Vegas, with the whole entrance room decorated with medieval flags and armour. \n\nWe were finally called in for dinner. Now, I want to preface this by saying that dinner is nothing special. You kind of go for the whole, goofy experience, not really the fine cuisine. You get tomato bisque, garlic bread, half of a chicken, a few potato wedges and a small thing of ribs and then an apple pastry for dessert. Everything is served separately, not all together, so you're eating everything one at a time. They are served to you by your \"wenches\". That said, while nothing was particularly impressive, nothing was bad either. You don't get cutlery, so you pick at everything with your fingers. However, they give you wetnaps and a hot towel at the end. My sister ordered the vegetarian meal and they gave her a veggie shish-kabob, which she said was quite good. \n\nDrinks are water or pepsi, or the drinks you order at the bar.\n\nNow, onto the show. We cheered and yelled like crazy people the entire time. We picked fights with other \"teams\" (people cheering for other knights) and they picked fights back. We laughed and cheered and jeered at the knights. The show consists of some horse tricks, a falcon flying over you and of course the knights battling. Everything is exceedingly cheesy and you just have to enjoy it for what it is. \n\nAnyway, this was a cheesy, good time. I would do this again in an instant...but only with the right crowd.\n\nPS - Our knight won! We think it was because we cheered loudest.","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0}

Not bad, but not great, and certainly not near the value you'd get uptown (and value is a very important aspect of dim sum, ask any Chinese person!) \n\nI suppose it'll do if I'm craving some har gow and milk tarts, but I'll stick to my uptown faves.","useful":5,"funny":2,"cool":3}

It never fails to offer a good meal.\n\nIf you've never had Afghani food, I'd compare it too... greek food with added spices. You have different kabobs (or kabAbs as their name implies) and meats of different variety and spices grilled on skewers (mostly).  Add some rice, some garden salad, and you have a middle eastern version of Greek food. \n\nAnyway, the food is good. Some may find it spicy, but most people I've brought here have really enjoyed it. The dishes are prepared when you order, or close to it, so it can be a 10-15 minute wait for your food.\n\nNearly all the meat dishes I've had are good here, here's a few:\nKofta: some mixture of beef, garlic and other spices.  It's garlic heavy, so bring some tic-tacs or a tooth brush if you're going back to work. It's the cheapest item, but it'll still fill you up and it's good.  Comes with two skewers.\nChaplee: think of two big burger patties with chilli spices in them. You'll get stuffed. May be a bit hot for some.\nSultani: the king of the dishes, the most expensive, it comes with a skewer of beef tenderloin or filet mignon (forget which, but it's delicious), and a kofta skewer\nTandoori: Tandoori chicken is flavourful, but sometimes a bit dry.  Comes with one skewer.\nChicken: chicken breast  with some spices. My least favorite, as the chicken isn't overly spiced and can be dry at times.\n\nOn average, it'll cost you about $10 for a plate without rice, and $13 for a plate with rice, depending on the meat you get of course.\n\nPro: simple, the food is really good\n\nCons: a bit pricey for the dinners here, it can be a long wait at lunch since they make the dish when you order, not a huge fan on the naan bread they give you here. It's Afghan type naan, I prefer the Indian naan. This naan, though fresh, is tougher and harder than Indian naan.\n\nTip: If you're having lunch, I'd suggest getting the kabob plate without rice. It's a few dollars cheaper and the dinner plate with rice will likely put you to sleep at work... it's HEAVY.   The rice though is delicious, so if you go with a group I'd suggest getting individual plates without rice, then ordering a side plate of rice. They give you plenty of rice and it's cheaper this way.  And you can portion it so you don't need an afternoon nap!","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":1}

They have a regular menu as well, but I've only tried the all you can eat menu here (twice) so that's all I'm going to review.\n\nFor about $28 after tip and taxes on a Friday, you get mounds and mounds of Kalbi ribs, bulgogi beef, pork, and other variations of Korean meats.

These are your typical kimchi, pickled radishes, etc. that you come to expect from any Korean establishment.  \n\nThe BBQs here are the typical gas burners, not the coal type which are so rare and hard to find in Toronto.\n\nMy biggest criticism with the all you can eat menu here is that you cannot order lettuce or other sides which are typically used to \"wrap\" the meat as part of the menu. Orders of lettuce will cost you extra.  This is a bit confusing to me, as the cost for lettuce is really, really cheap compared to the meat they're providing.\n\nAll in all though, I don't think there's anything distinctively special about this place, though if you want a large, unhealthy serving of meat (we all crave this once in a while) then it's a good choice.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":1}

The Ms. Vickie's batter is definitely the better of the two, have more crunch and texture, while the regular batter was soft and just not good. \n\nThe fish wasn't overly oily, which is good, but the fish itself was very dry.  You know how in good fish and chips, the fish will flake apart? That lovely texture that just falls apart in your mouth? Well, this isn't it. The fish was chewy, dry and definitely wasn't seasoned. I ended up throwing a ton of seasoning salt, lemon and tartar sauce on it just to give it some life. \n\nOnto the second part of the equation: fries.

I can certainly see why folks like the bagels, IF they like the soft and fluffy variety. They also toast up pretty well, which adds some good texture to it and is much more down my alley. The apple turnover ($1.15) was good, though the apple filling could have used more cinnamon. \n\nThey ran out of their $1 pizzas by Friday afternoon, since they're closed on Saturday and don't want to bake more in case they don't sell out that night.

This leads me to my 3rd point....\n\n(3) but man, it's goooooood\n\nSimply put, I've never had this much lobster in my life. Ever. There were 10 of us and we had the 10-12 set dinner, which comes with 14 lbs of lobster (done 2 ways), a king crab, fish, eel, deep fried oyster, lobster fried rice, soups and veggies so you don't feel quite as bad. \n\nThe amount of food here was absolutely ridiculous... and I eat a lot. Mountains of lobster friend with garlic and onion... it's staggering to see. You can get spicy versions, which I love.  Beautifully fried, it doesn't only look great, it tastes pretty darn good too. \n\nIf you're a seafood lover, you'll be in heaven. The oysters were served first, one per person, breaded and battered with chinese eggs (I don't know what to call it in english, but in cantonese it's \"ham dan\") they were fantastic. The king crab is served with egg whites, which was an interesting touch. The egg whites make the crab meat seem even smoother and silkier. The fish was your standard chinese steamed fish. The lobster fried rice was also really good. But the star of the show is clearly the mountains of lobster that come to your table.\n\nThe price of the lobster itself isn't so bad at $17\/lb. It's the king crab that gets you, at $40\/lb. I think our crab alone was close to $300. Quite honestly, we could have left out the king crab and we'd have plenty of food still, so next time I might order a la carte in that fashion. In fact, we took home two trays or lobster home (probably 1.5 lobsters).\n\nAlso, be sure to tell the server upfront that you want exactly 14lb (or whatever the set meal comes with). If they push back saying they don't have a lobster with that exact size and try to upsize you, just politely say no, and you can ask for several smaller lobsters instead, totalling 14lb. \n\nIf you get the set meals, you'll be spending $60-80 pp after taxes and tips, so be warned. If you manage to do the ala carte, it'd be much more reasonable, likely around $40 pp.","useful":14,"funny":2,"cool":2}

Some simple seating, a counter, and a wall with bags to your left is what your greeted with. This location was pretty clean and the staff was pretty friendly as well.

Simple enough, grab a bag the size you want, choose the base of the sandwich (I got the cubano) and choose all the fixin's your little hear desires.\n\nHere is where it sort of started going a little down hill. There were six of us which I know is a big order but it looked like they had a pretty organized line for the actual manufacturing of the sandwich. It took a lot longer for the sandwiches to be made than I thought. About 30 minutes for one or two of them. My sandwich was pretty poorly made with half of the ingredients falling out of it when I pulled it out of the now oily brown paper bag. The sandwich I asked for toasted and was warm on one side and the other was as if it came out of the fridge. Again it is a chain so my expectations weren't a gourmet melt or anything.

Now for those who know my posts etc. They know I love it when a place makes you feel as though you've never left and thats exactly how they make you feel. \n\nNow I REALLY really want to give this 5 stars but there are two big things that are nagging me. The first is the location, it is in sort of an odd place which is in between a sub shop and salad shop with a Yoga studio upstairs in a strip mall. It would be great if they were lucky enough to have a stand alone building but, such is life. The second is that I feel in this age and in Madison, even a beer bar needs to offer some liquor. I have had friends join me at this wonderful spot to be really disappointed that they didn't offer any sort of liquor. They settled for cider (simply because they don't drink beer) which is crazy to most but I understood it.\\\n\nSimply put by their own slogan (on the back of their shirts, and yes, one that I bought...) \"Brews Brothers: Where good people drink good beer\"","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Things are clean and organized and you don't have to go on a scavenger hunt for anything. Well laid out store so you don't feel pressured into other isles. \n\nNow the kicker to this place is the staff in my opinion. They are anything but helpful. Although I never asked a question or anything they were very concerned with their plans for the weekend and other work related drama when I arrived and departed. Not once did anyone ask if they could help me find something or if there was something particular I was looking for. You could here them talking and laughing from the back of the store which, i'm all for good fun at work but when you are that loud in a large store which customers are looking for something and just hear you laughing somewhere? It is a little frustrating. I didn't decide to buy anything the last few times I was here but I feel I might have if it were a little more welcoming here.","useful":2,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The older-style seats, floor, and stage with a couple of nice modern things thrown in to give it an updated feel. They have a second upper level which is sort of oddly proportioned and designed. It almost goes straight up so that people on the second level can have a view of the stage but it is very steep. So if you are intoxicated, I suggest staying on the first level... Furthermore the bar and drinks here are actually better priced than most concert places... It was $4 for a 16oz PBR which ya... It's PBR but for $4? Can't go wrong! The acoustics are pretty good but could be better because sound doesn't carry well in there for some reason. Also the bathrooms in the basement are absolutely disgusting and for some reason they always allow girls to come into the men's room if the women's is full... I think that is highly inappropriate and there needs to be new management or staff to help solidify that problem.

It is one of the most spectacular Sports bars on the west side. They have EVERYTHING here. Legends is kind of tucked away near the West Towne mall and the next most recognizable thing nearby is a Chucky Cheese. Straight away the only qualm I have with the place is the parking lot. Not enough parking what-so-ever. Not the end of the world though. You walk in through a corner entrance to reveal a huge wrap-around bar with TONS of tables and stools surrounding it.\n\nThere is a huge screen at the front along with dart boards to get you started on the Sports bar feel. Pool table in the opposing corner with a few slots as well. Now the kickers of this place. First the big screen at the front? That is mainly reserved for very large UFC fights!!!! YES one of very few bars in Madison will show them because of how costly they are to show. Can't get a great view of the screen? don't worry. They have probably over 15 other TV's surrounding the bar attached to the ceiling. I am not exaggerating one bit. You can't escape a TV in this place even if you wanted to. Which is awesome because they show pretty much every kind of sport known to man. The outdoor patio on the side if large and plentiful of seating where they still play the audio for games and yet you still have a clear view inside the window at current games.\n\nHead around to the back of the bar and there is a full-size volley ball court! Leagues and all. The other immediate thing you will notice is the awesome new Tiki Shack bar they HAND BUILT with a large (around 50\") TV mounted against the wall. They don't stock a ton back there but another pitcher of mediocre beer? Sure! They have bean bag boards and sometimes some special events like $1 Cheese burgers and not too long ago they even had a full-size lamb cooking back there! IT WAS DELICIOUS. They also have live music back there sometimes with a little stage in the corner, no real big names or anything but more than what any other kind of place would have.\n\nMost importantly, the employees and the family that owns this place is spectacular. They make you feel like a regular even if this is your first time there. If your a regular you feel like family. The owner of this place is always genuinely concerned with how you might be doing and how you are in his company and the establishment. If not my favorite #1 bar it is a very close second but I might be brave and say it is.\n\nMost nights end up as \"Legends?\" \"Yep\"","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":1}

Times I have gone in and never been helped when obviously looking for something, other times there have been a surplus of employees. \n\nMen's department is slight compared to the women's department which is ok I guess but a little disappointing considering the other Gap is in the West Towne mall which is Miles away. Store is always very clean and the dressing rooms are empty without clutter almost every time I have been there. They have a great AD behind the registers which is bright and can sort of just boost your mood... until you walk up to it and it gives you a migraine.\n\nThe main reason for the 3 Star rating is simply lack of selection for men.

You pass some quaint outdoor seating and enter into a somewhat confusing maze to find some of the main seating and the bar. Rich wood surrounding you as it melts you into relaxation before you even reach the bar at the back of the establishment. You explore this tightly packed place by walking down some stairs to another bar, which I am going to call \"the speak easy\" with white lounge seating in an intimate space that exudes class. Candles lit and people chatting.\n\nComing back upstairs, My buddy and I had some cocktails and steak sandwiches in what I call the \"Middle Al Capone room\" The reason I say that is because I imagine Al Capone sitting in the corner of this all wood room underneath the small little wall lamps with a stogie and a cognac relaxing after a hard day of moonshine running... Soothing lighting throughout with small intimate booths with some close friends. This is it... Probably going to be my new favorite place....","useful":4,"funny":3,"cool":4}

This particular location is seated well between West Towne Wall but closer the West Gate Mall.

I FREAKIN LOVE BARRIQUES. I must hold down my excitement to review this particular location though. Barriques coffee, tea, and treats? EXCELLENT\n\nThis particular location has a lot going for it and some not so much. The things I like most about it, is the location and the interior. This location is found right smack dab on the corner of Fish Hatchery Road and Park Street which is a HUGELY traveled intersection near downtown Madison. Plenty of sitting space, some comfy chairs and even a darkened area that seems... I don't know, quaint. It isn't super busy every time I have been here but it isn't dead either. Staff has been sometimes inattentive and once or twice downright rude but it only happened once or twice so I won't hold it against them. They also have an internet area in the back I think. I tend to stay toward the front of the store so I am not sure but I thought that was a really nice addition. 9 out of 10 times the store is spotless and finally it isn't cramped.\n\nNow onto some not so nice things (Sad Face). So the things I dislike most about this location are 1. the bathroom, and yes I know it seems mundane but if you read some of my other reviews this can make or break it. It isn't always as clean as it could be to put it nicely. \n\nAnother issue I have, Ironically enough, is the location. I know I said I enjoy the location and I do but it is right on the main drag so if you are there on a nice summers day or around 8:00, 12:00, or 4-6:00, all you will see is bustling traffic. Which, if you are trying to relax, is not the first thing that springs to mind. The other issue is that it doesn't seem to be as busy as it should be for being where it is. Why isn't that place packed all day! The reason I have found for this is that there is not much parking without walking a bit, which is great in the summer maybe or if your younger, but not so much in the winter. There is street parking but it is regulated so much that you would end up moving your car anyway. They have about 6 spots along the back of store but thats it.\n\nSo because I love their coffee and atmosphere so much this place gets a difficult 5 stars. The reason if because I don't want to have to park on a greatly busy street and cleanliness of the bathroom. Otherwise?

I am completely dissatisfied with this place. It is called a lounge and when you walk in it looks and acts like one. It has really nice accent lighting that calms you down and prepares you for a fun night. Until you see all the broskis and college type clientele. \n\nNow don't get me wrong I understand this is downtown and college kids like the place and all but it is a lounge. Even the staff is dressed pretty well to make it feel like a really classy place. The establishment is deceivingly small and they make it seem 10X bigger by using large mirrors on the walls but you realize quickly that the place is small, at least on the lower level... The reason I address this is because every time I have been here they had the upstairs closed for some unknown reason. When I asked the \"bouncer\" why it was closed he said it is only for when they are really busy, while I was being shoved around because everyone was shoulder to shoulder and on a saturday night... \n\nThe bartenders are inattentive and thats being kind, they are just shouting at all their friends and buddies who come in and give them special treatment even though I had been sitting there for about 20 minutes, NO that is not an exaggeration. When they come back with their friends' drinks they blatantly try handing shots over me and spilling on me. They apologize but don't offer anything in return and STILL WALK AWAY. The last time I was there and this happened I yelled at the bartender to get my beer and get the manager. The manager gave me my beer and a shot for free but this almost offends me. I am not easily bought like the rest of the drunken people there and I don't expect free stuff. Of course I didn't get another drink for a while after that but that's why I left $2 for my over $40 tab. Some might think it is rude but what are you really tipping those people for? More people tip better at the bar than at a restaurant... Who is doing more work? A server? or some person who literally makes 3 movements to hand you something... \n\nProbably do not plan on returning to this place unless there is minimal people.","useful":9,"funny":0,"cool":0}

There is never a shortage of fresh towels, the equipment is sprayed down to again keep cleanliness and you notice right away! Sometimes you can smell the cleanliness. Yep! Finally, it does get a little crowded here around 6-8 because everyone is getting off work. It isn't a huge deal because everyone is pretty generous and kind about allowing someone to get on a unit.

It was almost like a little getaway area. Beer selection? Extensive with some of the most interesting types of beers i have tasted in a while. They also have 1 pool table along with a dart board and some sort of video game... There was also some type of game in the right corner as you walk in but I cannot remember what. They have a jukebox there but from the looks of it, it seems to be a decoration but who knows.\n\nThis place was a lot of fun, relatively small compared to other places like it but great acoustics and oh, kind of a weird thing to add but extremely clean bathrooms! For some reason it was like entering a different world walking into the bathroom like it was part of a very nice restaurant or something but that is a good thing!

Sometimes you can find a Gem in here but then you see the price tag and have to go sell your car. I can't see anyone except for a celebrity shopping here and justifying the price they would pay.  \n\nAgain, I am all for some expensive clothing if you feel great in it, for example for men's jeans maybe $200 tops and they had better be spectacular and last for decades.

The people that work here though are awesome and really make you feel welcome. \n\nOn the other hand, agreeing with what someone else said, there are better burgers for better prices out there and I feel they could have made certain items on the menu a bit more normal? I wonder if that sounds odd because I may just be nitpicking but it seems like some things on the menu are cool and interesting like their PB&J burger but others seem OVER done to try to make them something out of the ordinary. I would have given this place 5 stars but I can't get over the overdone-ness of some items and when it WASNT happy our the drink prices were too expensive. All-in-all, its not a bad place to experience ever once in a while and I do have to say some food items are spectacular, the staff is outta-this-world, and its in a nice location.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

It is amazing! You have all of your groceries in one half of the store and the rest of the Target products you know and love in the other! It is great. The store is really well-kept up and it always clean and very professional looking. The staff there is extremely nice especially one particular manager who was very kind to us when I sat our front on black Friday for 9 hours :). There is always somebody walking around to aid people and they are so friendly about it. Not just the standard \"isle 4 go find it yourself\" type stuff. \"Let me show you where those are\". It is massive and it is in a much-needed developing area of my home town. There is some great stores going up there and a few fast-food joints! It is in a great location because the only other close target store is a 20-30 minute drive on the west side of Madison. Now Fitchburgians don't need to leave their own city finally! Also I suggest getting a Target credit card... Already low prices? with 5% off EVERY SINGLE PURCHASE!!!! It is exquisite!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I was not that happy with my experience. It started off excellently by first finding the tires I would like (which I love cars and knew what I was talking about and the sales person knew that straight away) which had to be ordered. No problem, total was $700 put $100 down, done and done. They even had the lowest price of even online for the tires I wanted! \n\nNow I had a scheduled time to put them on but with the warranty and such I didn't want to put them on too early which would 1. run down the warranty because it is on a mileage basis and 2. I didn't want to wear down the tread of the tires because it hadn't even snowed yet. So I pushed out the install date and it ended up being after the blizzard because as predicted... my norma tires were awful in the snow.\n\nSo I asked what the soonest time was to have them installed and took the time. The day arrives and I head in expecting to pay the remaining $600 for the tires. I had even called to confirm that my initial $100 didn't expire or was returned. Sat around and waited for them to finish and was called up to pay the balance. \"Alright your so your total is $700.68\" I said what? that can't be right. \n\nI told the sales person (same person I dealt with THE FIRST time I came in) that I had just called to confirm my $100 was still on there. He said yeah it is but the rest is $700. I said for what? For the four tires, no waste disposal (since I kept my tires) and the replacement on all four tires. I said I never discussed the replacement plan with anyone nor with the sales person for that matter. He kind of acted dumb and looked at his colleague like \"HUH wonder how that dun got on there\" Which I was not happy about. Come to find out, they do this to almost EVERYONE, they add it onto every sale without telling you because they make a commission off of the sale.\n\nThe whole time I was there they were asking each other who was on that sale or who's sale was it? I told the SP I didn't ask for it and don't want it and to take it off. Now I will say the replacement plan is sort of nice a $25 per tire its replaced no matter what happens, nail or pot hole... However its not nice if they don't tell you. In the end the guy covered all four tires for the price of three which I even argued there and hope one tire goes just to even out the cost.\n\nHere are the final parts. I should have mentioned earlier that because of where I work, I got a 10% discount as well off the whole deal but the dollar mounts i'm talking about is with that included. After I purchased the tires and had them installed I later went online to make sure the price hadn't come down on the tires. Which lead me to a rebate page... WHICH MY TIRES QUALIFIED FOR... buy four michelin tires and receive a $70 rebate. I was never told this once while working with my sales person nor by anybody else. I filed for it and got declined for some-odd reason (probably because I filed for the rebate the same day) but ended up calling the corporate office to find out why. The people over the phone were SO sympathetic about the replacement plan and the rebate issue. They approved my rebate Immediately and I received a couple of weeks later. \n\nEven though it all worked out I still wasn't told about spending an extra $100 for a replacement plan I never asked for, I was never told about the rebate which probably would have inclined me to purchase the replacement plan in full and pretty much got the run-around in store as to why it was on there.\n\nThe people seem knowledgable and fast but they will stick you with a nice bill if your not careful. Do some major research before going in there and TELL them ONLY what you need. If you want further information on their \"Extras\" just call or go online. I have been in sales and I will say a sales person will do anything to sell...","useful":10,"funny":1,"cool":0}

It is an extremely unique vibe to it with a nifty Koi tank and a nifty asian-sensation bar. This place isn't in the best location in my opinion and you really have to know where it is to attend a night out here. Personally I wish it was more in an obvious place because it really deserves more recognition than it is getting. This gives Fitchburg another cool place to go and relax aside from the Great Dane. \n\nThey have a great outdoor patio that is almost as big as their indoor seating and this is probably the one and only problem that I have with Atmoic Koi. That is the indoor seating, for some reason, in my personal opinion, it seems a bit cramped with not a ton of seating, when you are their on a busy night (friday or saturday) it seems impossible to find a seat. \n\nOther than that, the atmosphere is spectacular, one of my favorite features is the large wall sculpture of a Koi fish. It isn't true rock but it is made out of concrete I learned from one of the bar tenders which seems to have taken quite a bit of time! This gives such a classy feeling to this spectacular place. They also have a few TV's sometimes that have a cool movie on or some sports games etc... A shuffle board and some darts complete this hidden Fitchburg Gem for one of the greats in the Madison area alone.

Not once have I ever been given a for sure \"Yes we have that\" or \"Well let me check\"  while I have been searching. They are few and far between and I have been \"suggested\" to look in an area across the store but never taken to an area, said to ask anyone else, or had someone look for something for me. They just use their radios to ask someone who in response just says \"just have them (the customer) look in ' such and such an isle'\".

I have to say that I have met quite a few really nice and kind people who work here and they used to do a spectacular job. I have to say that in the recent year or two they have kind of lacked in good customer service. Let's start with some of the basic things in a review.\n\nThe location of this place is pretty great. It is right near the West Towne Mall on Madison's west side and it's in the \"Target Plaza\" where they have a lot of other great shopping. It is RIGHT on Mineral Point road so you can see it right as you pass it. The store itself is well kept and cleanly and is most of the time neatly organized. Always have the latest games, almost never have to wait for stock to come in. The other nice thing about this location being so close to the mall is that there is another Gamestop inside the mall. So if one or the other is out of stock on something usually the other store will have at least one or two in stock. These are some of the great things about this location... However...\n\nWhoever has read my review before will know that I am very concerned with Customer Service. The people who work at an establishment are the biggest deciding factor of whether I will enjoy a place or not. This place used to have some absolutely great employees that were always willing to help, explain the plot of a game. Tell you why you should or shouldn't buy a game, analyze the games that you may currently play and what games coming out you may be interested in. The people working there now just seem to expect you to know what your looking for and to buy it and reserve something else. I also like to give examples so let me give you my last one that seemed to have been the same experience for the last year and a half. \n\nI just went in here to get rid of some games I no longer play and get some coffee money. I was the only one in the store when I walked in and I was never greeted nor even looked at. So I perused for a moment or two then walked up to the counter to sell my items. As I walked up, 1 of the 2 workers never looked up at me as they walked away and into the back of the store. The other had his back turned to me and was continuing on some other task. I politely said excuse me as the gentleman spun around and said \"oh, the other guy will be right back i'm finishing something right now.\" I said alright cause I don't mind waiting, but about 5-10 minutes went by and I was still standing there so I started looking around a bit more when I look back to the counter the person who had his back to me was now on his phone doing nothing. I walked back up and he immediately turned back to \"what he was finishing.\" The other employee finally returned and asked if I wanted to sell the games I was holding in my hand. I said yes and he started ringing me out. He immediately asked for my ID and then gave me a receipt for store credit. Now I wouldn't have minded if I wanted to reserve another game or purchase something else in the near future but I rarely play video games anymore.\n\nI said oh I was actually looking for cash and instead of apologizing he very condescendingly said \"Really? you know that's like half of what you have right now\" I said I didn't care because I had all the games I wanted and that I don't play games that much anymore. He sort of rolled his eyes, \"umm... ok?\" he protested... Handed me my cash and didn't say a word so I left. I don't hold this against the store as a whole because I have had pleasant times here but that was outrageous. So hopefully they hire some more spritely and excited people about anyone who comes in. The video game market is not doing so hot so to exile people like that is just hurting it more. Getting people excited about games again is what they are all about! So I will continue shopping here for now but instead of an A-OK rating its more of an eh.... OK... rating.","useful":0,"funny":3,"cool":0}

This place is gonna take some describing so bare with me. You enter through a door in the corner of the bar where you first see an ATM (hint hint) and then find some seating to your right and the bar straight ahead. As you walk towards the bar, the place kind of bottlenecks where you find the stairs to an upstairs, the door the outdoor patio and lots of bar height tables. \n\nThe bar is runs almost the length of the building then wraps around a bit near the kitchen. BTW they make some GREAT bar food especially a patty melt that was soo good I ordered it immediately the next time I went. Anywho... They have a TON of draft beers and a TON of different liquors. Great big TV's right at the bar to be able to watch any game you want and then they also have a massive projection screen for some of the bigger games as well and to watch from upstairs.They also have some of the most friendly staff I have ever met in my entire life. THEY ARE GREAT! Great doesn't even describe it. They're jubilant! Yeah, that's right your learning new words!\n\nAnyways, Moving on to the upstairs, They have a pool table A SECOND smaller bar and another set of TV's! They also have darts and lots more seating up their. On most nights the upstairs is nice and quiet and not crowed at all so you can usually sneak in a couple games of pool and darts. Oh and this place is usually pretty clean but its a dive bar so spills can happen. Finally the outdoor patio wraps around the back of the bar just a tad and has some nice tables to sit at as well. Jeez, with all the seating you could sit a small town in there and it doesn't seem like that big of a building. Like I said it has some great staff, a nice building, and lots of seating.

Rubbish was all over, I mean not just the floor, but the counter tops at the concession purchasing area was filthy. As was the area where one grabs their condiments, napkins, what have you.  Then (as I always do in good habit) I take a restroom pit stop prior the movie. 95% of the sinks something was not working, whether it was the hot or cold, the drain, the soap. WAIT, not one drop of soap dripped.  Now, with that being stated I would not be consuming anything I purchased from the concession area. I will spare you the details of those stalls with the commodes.  I exited the 'restroom'\nNow, enter the actual theater for IT.  Filthy.\nThis goes beyond cleaning between showings.

I will skip that tale.  Then I tried it again 6 months later.  A friend and myself were seated at the bar.  The bar had about four other people and this female bartender we had was awful.  She was busy chatting and helping the two men on our opposite corner.  We would've been better off serving ourselves.  We asked for every little thing, I mean everything- utensils, water a drink and yes. Even menus. She had no regard or knowledge of the menu, let alone manners. What she did have was an attitude.  My thoughts with any business is this: she was hired by them, hence that speaks volumes of the establishment.  It is a reflection on the business.  I was in Downtown Summerlin last night with the same friend and we dined elsewhere.  As we walked by as I snapped the picture we recalled that lack of a personality bartender.

I told them I was going to upgrade those by another $30 or so, and was so excited to pick them up the day before Valentine's Day.\n\nWhen I went to pick them up today, I was shocked: They did put long-stemmed roses, which I didn't order, but they had scraggly stargazer lilies, even though I had specifically instructed them not to get stargazer lilies.  One of the rose stems was broken in half, with the flower just hanging straight down ... some of the leaves were chewed by bug or all dirty ... and a number of the leaf stems were also broken in half.  I was completely underwhelmed.  \n\nI am usually not one to complain, but I told them I was hugely disappointed in the flowers --- one of the ladies there acted annoyed, and kept reminding me that this was definitely worth the money I spent.  I stuck to my guns, and, to their credit, they tried to spruce it up and replaced the stargazers with a few white lilies (only about half as many).  I ended up going through the arrangement once I was in my car, cleaning it up, breaking off the ruined stems, etc ... \n\nThis may have been an anomaly, and they may normally do a fantastic job, but I will never use them again.","useful":9,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I love that Hubbard offers free classes to infants who are 2-6 months old.

She's unfortunately no longer with Hubbard but we really enjoyed the time we had with her. Classes are only thirty minutes long which is plenty of time when dealing with a newborn. We've had tears. We've had laughs. It's a crapshoot but always a lot of fun.\n\nMy only complaint is the cost after 6 months. Approximately $80 a month for one class a week, I can't imagine we'll be able to financially commit to this until our little one is well past a year old and in a solid routine. Until then, we probably won't continue with lessons until she's older.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

The best part of it all was my husband's shoe breaking during pre-ceremony pictures. He switched shoes with his best man so as to stay on solid ground during our wedding :) Coming in a close second was my father-in-law being peed on by one of the owner's dogs (in a bridal shop?!) when he went to go pick up his tux. A BIG strike two.\n\nThe icing on the cake was while my husband and I were on our honeymoon. Suzanne called my mother to tell her all of the tuxedos had not been returned (untrue.) While my mom calmly explained everything that had gone wrong, Suzanne yelled at her and accused my husband of doing something to break the shoe, that I was ungrateful, etc...I really didn't consider myself to be a bridezilla, found the comments to be totally unfounded and offensive toward myself, my husband and my mom. Oh, and the phone call was ended in a lovely professional way-she hung up on my mom after laying into her. Strike three, you're out.\n\nI know weddings don't go perfectly. After it was said and done the issues with the tuxedos were a joke in a our family. However, the treatment we received from Suzanne (the owner) was unprofessional, rude and childish. I can't recommend this shop to anyone. Spend a little more money and go somewhere that has more to offer than just selection.","useful":19,"funny":3,"cool":0}

The pasta here is mediocre at best but something about the start of your meal makes it all worth while.

I appreciated her getting back to me so quickly and her willingness to fit me into their schedule. That was about the extent of any positive experience I had with them.\n\nI was given an arrival time of 2-3 pm. At 3, the owner contacted me saying the girls were running about half an hour late...no big deal. At 4:15, no one had come yet. I was then called by the crew saying they had run out of gas and would have to reschedule. I said that would not be possible because the reason I needed the cleaning done that day was because we were moving in the following day. They said they would try to get on the road and figure something out. At 6 pm they finally arrived. The girls were very sweet but on top of everything that had happened, I was expecting a thorough cleaning. They did a great job on the bathrooms but I felt everything else was either brushed over or not noticed at all. One reason we needed cleaning was because the previous tenants had a dog with very long hair. At the end of our cleaning, there was still hair and dirt on the \"mopped\" kitchen floor, the inside of the fridge, freezer and cabinets had not been touched. I don't know if my experience was a fluke but it added a lot of anxiety to an already stressful week. My husband and I have spent the last three days cleaning what should have already been a clean townhouse. I still ended up paying what I would have if the correct appointment time had been kept and at the end of all of it, I received an e-mail saying if I did a Yelp review I would receive $20 off my next appointment.

My husband gave our pager back and the hostesses stood there like deer in the headlights.

The quality of the filet is the only thing that gets this review rounded up to three stars. Read on for more details.\n\nWe decided to catch an early dinner (after skipping breakfast and lunch) on Saturday. I made easy reservations on Open Table for 5pm. When we pulled up, both of us were pretty surprised by the exterior. The restaurant was in a newer looking strip mall, next to a nail salon. Not the swanky digs that I was expecting. We walked inside to an empty restaurant, as they had just opened. The host, who turned out to be our waiter, asked us if we had reservations. Yes, we did. We were seated at a small two top by the wall. I guess they couldn't spare a more roomy table. The interior of the restaurant felt like they wanted to make it look and feel upscale on a budget. \n\nSo, Hot Stone Grill's schtick is kind of like a fondue restaurants. Switch out the hot pot for a 600 degree volcanic stone. Given this description, you would figure that the food would come out raw and you would get to cook it. Well, that wasn't quite true. The filet came seared on both sides, sitting on the stone. The shrimp and scallops came cooked but sitting on the stone cooking further. I was hoping to get the ahi tuna but they didn't have any. The fish selection was salmon and mahi mahi. But after reading the negative review about the quality of the fish, I decided on shrimp and scallops instead. In hindsight, I wish I had just ordered a filet. \n\nThe quality of the filet was excellent, and it was kitschy fun to be able to sear the meat on the stone before eating it. We like our meat rare so we pushed the meat off the stone and threw it back on just before eating. I'm not sure what the big hoopla is over their demi glace. It was pretty bland. I preferred the peppercorn sauce, which had much more flavor. The sauces that came out with the seafood were both ok. The seafood was very bland, only having been seasoned by salt. The sides were soooo boring. The mashed potatoes seemed like those out of a box. The veggies of the day were overcooked, underseasoned, sauteed yellow bell pepper strips, onions, and zucchini. Very disappointing for a place that charges $30 per plate. I was also surprised that they didn't offer a bread basket or something. I feel like that is really par for the course. \n \nOur waiter was ok, just really awkward. He was trying way too hard. I mean who tells a customer to come up to look at the beer selection... shouldn't you have a list or something. He hovered and tried to make awkward conversation.\n\nOverall, we won't be returning. While the filet was very good, there are much better places to visit for the price.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Deep Sea is a seafood market that sells the freshest seafood around, from 11-2 Monday through Saturday it turns into a lunch spot. It is quite unassuming from the outside. You walk into a simple, clean space. The menu changes daily depending on what is fresh that day. There are a few items that you will always see on the menu. My favorites so far... Any version of the tuna Sandwich, Mahi Mahi Tacos, and the Blackened Catfish Po'Boy. You have two options for sides, steak fries or cilantro slaw. I always get the cilantro slaw. Which is fresh and not mayo heavy. The cilantro adds a pleasant zing to the side. I would be really excited it they added more side choices - maybe a salad or soup option would be nice. \n\nThey have a small seating area with 5 tables total. The tables fill up during peak lunch times. My suggestion, grab your lunch to go and find a nice bench to eat it on and enjoy the outdoors.

I found out that they were remodeling. I learned they recently changed ownership. The interior is small. They had a list of fro yo flavors on a chalk board. Some of them said scoop next to the flavor. I was confused, so the guy at the counter clarified that they actually scoop the fro yo out of a container. That's a first for me. I tried the original tart and the peanut butter chocolate, which was scooped. I didn't much care for the texture of the scooped fro yo. The original tart was nice and tart so I went with that. I wasn't the largest fan of the texture. A bit too icy for my taste. Their pricing is set by size but I didn't like how they charge 50 cents per topping. A cup of fro yo can get pricey quick that way. I was intrigued by the taro mochi but disappointed after trying it. Way too gummy in texture and, except for being purple, didn't remind me of taro at all.\n\nI'd be willing to try them again next time I'm up in Noda, but they don't make my list of favorites for fro yo. \n\nNote: Seating is a challenge and the sidewalk outside the shop gets really crowded when it's busy.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Get there a little early to secure your favorite spot. The sense of community at y1 rocks. Everyone I've met has been really great. My favorite class is the heated Baptiste Power Vinyasa Yoga. I always leave drenched. My favorite instructor was Daniel McAll. He rocks. \n\nFor the newb:\nDon't worry! I'll admit I was a Yoga newbie when I first stepped through the doors of Yoga One. I came at the recommendation of a girlfriend who practiced here. I'm so glad that I gave it a shot! You really don't need anything to give it a try. Just wear comfy athletic clothes and bring a bottle of water! They have mat and towels to rent. \n\nWhen I first walked in I saw the smiling faces of the staff ready to help. I told one of the ladies that I was new and I wanted to take a class. She explained the rates and had me fill out some short paperwork to get me in their system. They offer walk-in rates, which are $15 per class. Or for new students, they offer an intro deal for 31 days of practice for $31. They also offer a ton of $5 classes too! Great option for those that don't want to commit to one month.\n\nThe space is beautiful. It is a bit on the small side but they fit a lot into it without making it feel too cramped. They have a retail space that sells everything you could want, from mats and towels to clothes. They sell snacks and drinks too. \n\nThe main (heated) room is large and easily accommodates many yogis. I appreciate the tape on the floor to show you where to park your mat. It keeps everyone lined up nicely. Grab a spot and stretch out. They have blocks and straps for everyone to use. The classes usually have at least one assistant that walks around adjusting your form. You can really feel a difference when the tweak your body. Don't worry about being sweaty! Everyone is and no one cares. \n\nThese classes will have you sweating. I've practiced with many different instructors and I definitely had my favorites. I would seek out there classes specifically which is easy to do on their website. Consider taking the 11 week foundations course. It'll really help with your practice. \n\nThe studio is tucked in the back of parking lot. Look for Bistro La Bon and Family Dollar. Parking is never a problem. Some classes are more crowded than others but I always felt like i had enough space. The bathrooms are small but there are changing rooms in the hall and in the front.

One of those cravings are arepas from the Quiero Arepas food truck. If you ever find yourself in Denver, make sure you track them down! So, I found Arepas Grill (thanks, Yelp!) and I headed down to check them out. Just a note... The street address on Yelp is wrong. It is located at 4740 Old Pineville Rd #A. Right next to it's sister restaurant, Colombian Bakery. I walked in and the place was empty. No seriously, there weren't any employees... I waited for a solid three minutes until someone showed up to help me out. Which was fine, as it gave me time to look over the menu. I decided on the Carne Mechada arepa ($6.00) and maracuya (passion fruit) drink ($3.00). He took my order and disappeared to the back. He reappeared a bit later with a freshly made arepa. He proceeded to cut it open and stuff it with the shredded beef and cheese. I asked for the spicy, avocado sauce that I am accustomed to having my arepa served with. The passion fruit drink was awesome! Very fresh tasting and refreshing. I'm on the fence about the arepa. I like how fresh the arepa itself was, but I wasn't really impressed with the fillings. It was definitely tasty, but I am used to my arepas being fixed up with more than just meat and cheese. A little more garnish would have put them over the top! This place could definitely earn the fourth, and even fifth, star easily with a little bit of improvement. They should take a look at Quiero Arepas menu! I would be psyched if they added something like the La Havana to their menu! I'll visit Arepas Grill next time an arepa craving strikes!","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":2}
