A kitschy, franchise pizzeria that makes totally funkadelic (and awesome) pizzas with a great beer selection. We've been Mellow fans since living in Denver and we were psyched to see that there was a Mellow on Selwyn. The portabella mushroom appetizer is awesome and could totally be an entree. It's a large portabella mushroom cap baked with artichokes, feta and sundried tomatoes served on top of spring greens with a balsamic reduction. Our favorite pizza is the Maui Wowie pizza. This pizza is loaded with toppings. I highly recommend subbing the banana peppers for candied jalapenos. Those candied jalapenos up the spice level and compliment the pizza really well. The pizzas seem pricey but when you see what comes out you'll see it's money well spent. I love their crust. Perfect texture, slightly sweet taste... Brushed with butter and sprinkled with parm. Divine.\n\nHelpful Tips:\n- Parking is never a problem. If the top deck is full, head down to the garage.\n- Service has always been good at this location.\n- They can easily accommodate large groups. \n- They have TVs in the bar that are always tuned to sports. \n- If you frequent the Mellow, make sure you join the Beer Club. \n- This location offers GFree, vegan crusts","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":1}

I am so disappointed by my experience. I called Gigi's Cupcakes at 3:00 pm today to see if they had mini cupcakes. My girlfriends were getting together for a Girls Night and I thought that cupcakes would be a great addition.  The employee that picked up the phone, Lindsey, had a less than enthusiastic tone. She couldn't have sounded more apathetic. I asked her about the mini dozen cupcakes and she said that they had them for pick up. I told her that I would be headed in. I was clear across town and I made my way down to South Park to Gigi's. I walked in at 4:00pm and there were two teenage employees behind the counter. I informed them that I had talked to Lindsey and I was there to pick up the dozen mini cupcakes. They tried to find them and asked if I had reserved them. I told them about my conversation with Lindsey and they told me that she was in the restroom and that I would have to wait for her. She came out a while later and seemed confused. She asked if she had taken my name. She hadn't. She then told me that they were sold out of the mini dozens. Wait... what... She told me that there were four when I called but they had all sold. Seriously... WTF. Why didn't she tell me that when I called. No offer to hold a dozen. Nothing. They best she could offer me as a solution was 15% off a dozen full size cupcakes ($3.25 each or $3.00 each if buying a dozen). Whoop dee doo... a dozen minis is $15... A dozen full size, even with the discount, would have been more than double that amount. I drove all the way across town to leave empty handed. What a waste of time and gas.\n\nAll three employees were so incredibly apathetic and couldn't care less about being there. The customer service was simply awful. I will never return and I cannot recommend that anyone visit this location.

Gelato holds a special spot in my tummy... It's one of my fave frozen treats. Charlotte now has a legit gelato place in a great location. This cute little gelato shop popped up in the middle of Park Road Shopping Center. \n\nLike most gelato shops they had a variety of flavors made with locally sourced ingredients. They had about 8 flavors ranging from the requisite vanilla and chocolate to fresh cantaloupe sorbetto and lemon ricotta. Make sure to sample a few! Every flavor I tried was good. I recommend getting the medium size ($5) which allows you to get up to two flavors! I decided on chocolate and stracciatella. Fantastic combo!\n\nThe store was aesthetically pleasing. White building, nicely decorated interior, but the thing I didn't like was how the gelato was presented. I'm used to gelato shops creating elaborate displays of their gelato. I usually pick it based on how good it looks in the tray (yeah, yeah... how vain of me... lol). I couldn't actually see any of the gelato until it was scooped out of the container. I guess it's just different from every other gelato shop I've been to. \n\nThe other minor annoyance... Va Da Vie closes so early! (Hours Tues-Sun 11:30am to 8pm) While I really enjoyed their gelato, I usually want frozen treats after dinner on a Friday or Saturday... well after Va Da Vie closes. \n\nAs many other Yelpers have stated, this is a stand alone building and not a store front in the shopping center.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend checking them out.

These companies actually create specific items to sell exclusively at factory stores (lower quality = lower cost). Banana Republic, Coach, Eddie Bauer, Gap (and many more) are all guilty of it... If you are looking for bargain deals on full price merchandise (likely from last season), go to a true outlet store (TJ Maxx, Off 5th, etc).","useful":1,"funny":1,"cool":0}

This was my first time attending the Yiasou Greek Festival and I was not disappointed. It was everything I expected from a great Greek fest - Authentic Greek cuisine, cultural exhibits, dancing, music, art, and shopping. KC & I went on Saturday around 7 and BOY was it packed!\n\nThe space was small and there were a lot of people and things packed in. It was difficult to navigate the tight pathways due to the crowds. Just be patient. Lots of people were loitering in the walkways making traffic move slowly.\n\nThe food was really the highlight for me. We got the baked chicken platter, which for $11, was a great deal. It came with a quarter chicken, triangle of spanikopita, greek salad, dolmade, pastisto, a piece of bread, and your choice of tea or coffee. I got white meat but they do not ask if you want dark or white meat. I bet you can request either if you have a preference. It was a TON of food. Everything was excellent. We also ordered a gyro. So good!\n\nFor dessert, we bought an assortment of pastries and a baklava sundae. The baklava sundae wss worth the price of admission alone. Enough to send you into diabetic coma. Three generous scoops of ice cream topped with a scoop of baklava bits. Amazing.\n\nA few things I learned for next year...\n\nDivide and conquer - There are a lot of different spots that serve food. There were different menus offered inside and outside. I wanted a platter and KC wanted a gyro so we got my platter and then found out we had to wait in a different line outside for the gyro. When you are outside, look for the signs on the tent that tell you what is served in that line. I also wanted a to try a feta pie but I found out that we would have to wait in a different line for that. You can't get anything else. The lines for food were really long but they moved quickly. Next year we will split up get our respective food choices and meet back up to enjoy them!\n\nCash is king - There were food lines that accepted credit\/debit but they were not well labeled. Definitely bring cash. It would suck to wait in a long line and find out they don't take cash. There were a few ATMs around but I'm sure the fees were exorbitant.\n\nParking sucks - We found parking a few blocks over in the neighborhood. I would recommend taking the light rail or, at the very least, carpooling with friends. They offer a parking shuttle but you'll have to wait. Oh and avoid driving on East Blvd at all costs. The traffic is awful. \n\nGo early - The food was crave-worthy and I wanted to reprise the meal on Sunday after a long day of watching football. I decided to try out the drive-thru dining option that the festival offered. I patiently waited in a long line of cars to turn onto Worthington. When I did, I was disappointed to see that most of the food was crossed off the list. I was able to order a gyro and a piece of spanikopita but all the pastries were sold out. Until next year... \n\nFun fact: yiasou is the Greek word for hello, goodbye, and cheers.","useful":5,"funny":2,"cool":1}

Not spicy and not really salsa, but ok. We each ordered our own combo taco plate ($10.50) which came with two tacos and a side. I got one BBQ Mahi taco and one Tavaruva Wahoo taco with fruit as my side (seasonal). I was incredibly underwhelmed with my food. The fish in both were way overcooked and dry.

They brought bottles of salsa to go with the tacos, so I sampled those with chips. The green salsa was incredibly mild and slightly bland. The red salsa had a nice smoky flavor and subtle spiciness. \n\nWe ordered an assortment of tacos - pork belly pastor, fish taco, short rib, and a spicy pork.

So imagine my excitement when I was able to get my hands on some VIP tickets! We showed up right around 12:00. There was a fairly long line of people wearing neon colored wrist bands. We got our ID's checked and we joined the line of thirsty patrons. In exchange for a small ticket, they hand you your sampling glass. About half the festival was laid out on the parking lot with the rest opening out to the park. It was a warmer day, so the shade that the trees provided were a welcome refuge. Many people brought their own blankets, folding chairs and some even had coolers. There were a few people with pretzel necklaces and even a guy in costume. Various vendor tents handing out swag filled in the spaces between sampling tents. Our fair city's CM was out there too! \n\nI'm glad that we were able to get the VIP tickets for the extra hours (12-2) before the general admission crowd is let in. The lines grew substantially after 2pm and vendors had already run out of things by then (like the high end bourbon table). If you want to beat the crowds and have the full gamut of choices, spend the extra $10 on the VIP tickets. \n\nSo, why three stars you may ask? My biggest complaint mirrors that of Mac K's, how are you going to call a festival Beer, Bourbon and BBQ and only represent two of three things... There was plenty of beer & bourbon (and other spirits) but there were only two BBQ vendors (Queen City Q and one I don't remember the name of) and no samples. Luckily, they offered re-entry and you could just walk over to the mall for more food options (and bathrooms & air conditioning!). If you are a beer and bourbon fan, it's worth attending.

We went in on a Wednesday around 7:00pm. It was pretty quiet inside with only one other table occupied. \n\nWe walked in and saw the order counter in front of us, two large LCD's displaying the menu above, and coolers full of beer on the left. They had a good selection of craft and Mexican beers. The decor was plain and simple. Nothing exciting. We ordered, paid, and sat down. Not long after, they called my name and we picked the food up at the counter. \n\nThe food:\n\nArepa - The star of the plate! Tender, well seasoned chicken stuffed inside a fresh corn flatbread and topped with cheese. I would go back just for this! It is a sizable portion, too.\n\nPupusa - Spinach and cheese filled. I was largely unimpressed with this. It was really dry and kind of hard, like it had been reheated.\n\nEmpanda - Chicken and cheese filled. Unfortunately, the chicken was dry and the filling was under-seasoned.  It outside was nicely cooked. \n\nTaco Authentico - Steak. Not too bad but not that exciting.\n\nChips - Warm. Thick. Seasoned (but not evenly). I was ok with them but they weren't my favorite. \n\nSalsa bar - I was largely unimpressed with the salsa bar. The ice was all melted and most of the containers were empty. It definitely did not look like it did in Ben G.'s photo. Three of the salsas were in squeeze bottles. The hot salsa was hot enough to burn your face off. I'm not a hot\/spicy food whimp by any means, but this was straight up burn with no flavor. Extremely underseasoned. The taste reminded me of habaneros that had been blended and bottled. Not my favorite. The salsa verde was supposedly hot but it wasn't that spicy and also flavorless. The best out of the batch was the pink sauce. It wasn't so much a salsa as a crema. I'm not really sure how the pickled onions and cabbage constituted a salsa. \n\nI like the concept of Sabor but their food just didn't impress me. I'd be willing to give them another shot.

Parking can be a pain, but if you know the secret spots around NoDa you'll be fine. After checking in with the hostess, I made my way to the beautiful bar to order a cocktail. I decided on the Manhattan, which was deliciously crafted. The interior area was a little crazy and cramped but people were very polite and courteous. I grabbed my drink and made my way out to the front patio area. When my table was ready, they sent a text to my phone. \n\nIn terms of food, I ordered the smoked deviled eggs, biscuits with bacon jam, chicken tenders, fried chicken, mac-n-cheese, brocollini with pancetta, and okra with bacon jam. The fried chicken was jammin'. Perfectly seasoned and cooked. The chicken tenders were nicely breaded and the ranch was delicious. I was pretty happy with everything. I honestly don't know what would make this place 5-stars for me, but it just wasn't. Maybe a second trip will get that 5th star.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I have no doubt that Nom Nom Burger will be around for a while. From the Yelp event from a bit ago to each subsequent visit after, Nom Nom Burger has consistently delivered. With each visit being just a bit better than the last. I finally feel ready to dish out a five-star review.\n\nWe have sampled a fair amount of the menu. Some favorites... the Korean Kalbi Burger, the Bahn Mi Sandwich, the Pad Thai Burger, and the Ahi Tuna Burger. All excellent choices. \n\nThis last visit, we went with a modified version of the special. The special was a chicken sandwich with grilled pineapple and a habernero mayo. I really wanted a burger, so I asked to have the special made with a burger ($2 up-charge). They meat is excellent. Very flavorful. The owner shared a lot of information about why they chose Sterling Beef instead of Black Angus. The Sterling was a great choice! Excellent, flavorful meat. The buns are excellent as well.\n\nThe ahi tuna \"burger\" was excellent. Perfectly seared tuna between rice patty \"buns.\" The wasabi aioli added a nice spice. The soy sauce dipping sauce was a little awkward to dip the sandwich into but definitely added to the sandwich. \n\nI got sweet potato fries ($1 up-charge... totally worth it) and they were awesome. Not too thick, not too thin, nicely cooked and served with a spicy aioli dipping sauce. The shrimp chips are legit too. Definitely worth experiencing if you have never tried them.\n\nAlso, they now have beers on draft!! Awesome addition!\n\nBoba boba boba! Yes, please. Even if it is the powdered kind. Taro boba FTW. I'm just waiting for Lavender Milk Tea... Everyone request it so they'll get it!\n\nThe owner is super passionate and so friendly. He is always happy to share his passion with you and, also, listen to your suggestions and feedback. \n\nA note to the servers.. please don't forget to ask me how I want my burger cooked.

I signed in at the front for waxing as was greeted by Ly (pronounced Lee). She pointed at a black office chair in the corner. As Nathan D. mentioned, the setting was a bit weird. Don't expect a nice, serene waxing room. They should at least invest in one of those padded massage tables for their waxing area. Aside from the setting, Ly did a great job.

Yelpers, get ready to have your taste buds delighted. \n\nI've been anxiously awaiting Tupelo Honey's arrival to the Charlotte food scene. I've heard nothing but amazing things about it but the 1.5-2 hour wait at the one in Asheville left me pining away. But not anymore, as we have our very own! It fills the space once occupied by the Pewter Rose Bistro.\n\nWe were lucky enough to join Tupelo Honey Cafe for a soft opening tonight. Usually restaurants use soft openings to work out kinks and problems, but it didn't seem like they really needed it. Everything was already operating like a smooth oiled machine. The service was excellent and the food was all superb. They were serving a limited menu but there was still something for everyone. \n\nHomemade Pimento Cheese and Tortilla Chips - Awesome. The pimento cheese was served hot, reminiscent of a Southern version on queso dip. The chips were also hot and fresh. \n\nBiscuits: Fresh biscuits served with Tupelo honey and berry jam. So.Freakin.Good. My search for the best biscuit has ended. Tupelo wins. These biscuits are light, fluffy, flaky, buttery, salty, and just damn good. \n\nSHOO-Mercy Shirmp and Grits: Oh man. A dozen perfectly cooked, succulent shrimp with bacon, caramelized onions, spinach, and sauteed mushrooms all served over goat cheese grits... Read that again... Goat cheese grits! If you aren't a fan of goat cheese, skip this dish as it is a very dominant flavor. Or better yet, try them and you may discover that goat cheese isn't all that bad like I did :) \n\nI also tried the Southern Fried Chicken Saltimbocca. So, so, so good. The chicken was perfectly cooked. So juicy. The country ham, Havarti and Marsala sauce pushed the dish over the top. The cheese smashed cauliflower were a bit of a let down. They just weren't as exciting as I wanted them to be. \n\nFinished the dinner off with a piece of Bourbon Pecan Pie. Perfect crust. Tons of pecans on top and ooey gooey pecan pie filling in the middle. You could smell the butter in every bite. Definitely the perfect desert for those with a sweet tooth. \n\nSide notes... They share the parking lot with The Liberty. They are on the second floor. There are two staircases and an elevator you can use to get up to them. The patio looks awesome! Can't wait for the weather to get nice to enjoy it. The space inside is beautiful. I love the exposed brick. They have a really nice bar area with TVs and a great selection of local beers on tap and tasty cocktails. Their mint iced tea was a bit on the sweet side for me but I loved the fresh mint flavor. Our waitress, Kat, was very friendly and attentive.\n\nI can't wait to try out more of their menu!! See you soon Tupelo Honey Cafe :)","useful":11,"funny":3,"cool":6}

It's a self serve spot with 12 flavors. Unfortunately, two were down for cleaning when I visited. You can sample as many flavors as you like but you need to ask the people at the counter for the cups. They keep them hidden, probably to deter people from just snagging samples and leaving without a purchase. \n\nI sampled a few and enjoyed most of them. Most of the ones I sampled had a really nice, smooth consistency (read, not icy!). They had a nice mixture of sweet and tart flavors. They had 4 tart flavors out of the 10 they were serving at the time Which is more than most places offer. The thing that got me... TARO fro-yo. Oh yum yum!! It was a nice consistency, which an appealing purple hue. The taro flavor was mild but ever present. I also enjoyed the key lime and cheesecake swirled together.\n\nLike most self-serve fro-yo places, they only have one size cup (large!). So, be careful filling it up. Otherwise, you will, very easily, have an $8+ cup in your hands. The toppings bar was messy and the fruit didn't look all that appealing. I opted to pass on toppings, as the taro was good all on its own.\n\nSo, my biggest complaint... Price! I know they have to pay the rent, which is probably outrageous being in a mall, but come on! They charge about 10 cents more per ounce than comparable self-serve fro yo places. Oh well... I'll be back just for the taro fro-yo.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":1}

Most are sweet with only 2 tart options when I visited. The flavors do rotate. I liked the consistency, not too creamy and not icy.  Some of the flavors definitely made me think soft serve and not fro yo... Good? Bad? Undecided. But I noticed that it melted really fast. By the time I dispensed it into my cup, put the toppings on, and paid for it, there was a decent melted pool in the bottom of my cup. That made me a little sad. They had some samples of their fresh made waffle cones\/bowls. Delish. I would definitely recommend their waffle products!\n\nI teeter totter between liking self-serve vs. full serve fro yo places. Menchie's is a self-serve joint. Which means: \na) You can sample as many flavors as you want. Just grab the small paper sample cups on the counter. \nb) You can put all 12 flavors in one cup if you so desire\nc) You can top away and decorate to your hearts desire.\n\nBut I must warn you, self serve places definitely have their negatives. \na) So, when you pay by the ounce you gotta be careful how much you put in that cup. They only offer one size cup, which is quite large(!) and easy to fill if you aren't swift handed with the dispensing lever. The toppings bar is quite dangerous as well... Fill up your cup too much and you may be walking away with an $8 cup of fro yo. My cup was around $5 and I felt like I went pretty easy filling up the cup. It was maybe 1\/2 full. \nb) Toppings are also self-serve... I try not to think of the bogger picking little fingers that have been all over those scoops. But hey, some germs never killed anyone right... think of it as free immune system training! \nc) The toppings bar options weren't that great\/healthy. They had plenty of dry toppings - crushed cookies, cereal, gummi bears, choco chips, and many other hfcs laden options. But I thought the fresh fruit area was lacking. The fruit I saw was cut into large, unappealing chunks and some of it didn't look all that fresh. \n \nWhile not my favorite fro yo joint in the QC, it does deserve a mention. I like this location better than other Menchie's locations I've visited (it's a franchise). Sign up for a Smileage card if you are a frequent visitor.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":0}

The pineapple\/cheese sauce that the chicken was sitting on was cold (maybe it was supposed to be) and too sweet for my liking. The temperature contrast between the chicken and sauce didn't do it for me. My coworkers ordered the Arroz Con Pollo (ACP) and Cali Burrito and seemed to enjoy it. My biggest complaint... they charge 25 cents per take out item.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I decided not to judge a book by its cover and walked in. Besides, I had just driven quite a distance from center city to get here. \n\nGary greeted me when I walked in and I was surprised to see a very clean, contemporary space inside. He asked me what I wanted done and I explained to him that I had already had my nose pierced but it had been years since I removed it. He took me back to the piercing chair and explained to me all the sterilization and sanitation procedures they have in place. He told me he opened this shop because he had gone to piercing studios with his daughter and he didn't like how they were dark and dingy. He wanted to open shop where he would be comfortable having his daughter go alone. \n\nHe washed up, put gloves on, and got to work. The whole process was over very quickly.

I was in need of a pedi and near South Park Mall. I had a really bad experience over at a salon in the mall, so I got on Yelp and found Vintage. It's on the second floor of the small shopping center across from South Park Mall. Plenty of parking in the lot. Walking in, I noticed a grand opening sign. The space inside was large and very clean. The ladies greeted me, asked me what service I wanted, and then instructed me to pick a color. They then asked me what scent I would like for my pedi scrub and lotion. The choices were cucumber, green tea, or apple. I chose green tea and sat in the pedi chair they had ready for me. They offer beverages - water, soda, or red & white wine. I asked for a glass of red, beware: it's a sweet wine - Think arbor mist. \n\nThe pedi itself was nice. They use OPI cuticle, base and top coats. The polish wall is expansive. The price is right. $35 for a pedi but the service is equivalent to deluxe pedis at most salons. They do a scrub with massage, masque with massage, lotion with massage, and hot towel. Love how many times they massage! I'll be back next time I'm in the area and looking for a little pampering. \n\nMy only feedback would be to offer an express pedi and what's with the $70 pedi?!

The bowl had an interesting combination of ingredients but I don't know that it really worked. There were also only 3 very small pieces daikon (pickled radish). A little more would have been nice for some more texture. A larger serving container would have also been nice. It was hard to get to the ingredients buried in the bottom without kicking the things on top out on to the table. \n\nOverall, I'd be willing to give them another shot but they'll have to improve a few things before I'll return.","useful":2,"funny":1,"cool":1}

I saw the big silver bus parked on South Blvd on my way home and it piqued my curiosity. I have a huge soft spot (found in my midsection) for food trucks and I had yet to sample the Chrome Toasters fare. I hurried home and convinced KC with much arm-twisting to go grab a bite and a beer. Ok, he didn't need much convincing... I mean come on, food truck fare + beer = awesome evening. Or so I thought...\n\nWe approached the Chrome Toaster and saw that they no longer had their menu written on glass by the door, but on a small lcd screen in the same location. I tried to, like an idiot, scroll the menu down, as some of the descriptions were cut off. It is not a touchscreen... I looked stupid trying. They should do something to fit the entire menu on the screen and save people like me from assuming it was a touchscreen. So, I never got to see what the descriptions or prices for the Yukon potatoes, tarro root chips (No, that isn't a typo. That's how they spelled taro on their menu.) and Mexican street corn. Their street sandwich section of the menu had six choices but none of them were the ever so popular Philly sandwich, that previous reviewers raved about. I was disappointed to see that it was missing. A girl popped her out of the bus doors to take our order. I asked her if they were doing the Philly anymore and she said they do but it is on the \"secret menu.\" Ooh... secret menu... I felt cool. So, I asked her what else was on this secret menu. She bluntly stated, \"Well I can't tell you.\" Umm... So I asked her how I was supposed to find out what is on the menu if she couldn't tell me. To which she had no intelligible response. Muttering something about how she didn't even really know what was on this oh-so-top-secret menu. Whatever. That kind of annoyed me. And made me wonder what other delectable items I was missing out on. \n\nSo, we ordered a Philly sandwich, Mexican street corn, and Yukon potatoes. Our food took forever. We waited... and waited... and waited some more. In that time, you could see how inefficient their ordering and delivering process was. The girl taking orders was also the \"waitress.\" She had to run orders into World of Beer with only a name to track down the owners. WOB was hosting trivia that night so it wasn't particularly quiet. She would disappear for a while, and return to find a line of confused looking customers that would be ready to order. Poor thing also didn't have a tray, so she could only take what she could carry. If you guys are reading this, invest in a tray. Most of the time, food trucks operate with the assumption that their customers, after ordering, will linger around and wait for their food. Well, I can't blame people for taking a seat and getting some beer, because the food wasn't coming out a particularly snappy rate. Yes, I realize it was their first day back in a while but this wasn't their first time at the rodeo! They had been a fully operating food truck in the past. \n\nOk, so the food... Meh sums it up really well. The corn was half burnt, cold, and the kernels were shriveled up from being overcooked. I've had epic legit, elote (Mexican street corn) and this was a far cry from it. The Yukon gold potatoes, while hot enough to burn your tastebuds, left a lot to be desired. They were not discernibly seasoned and the texture left something to be desired. The Philly was ok. The meat was piping hot and the bun was very fresh but this sandwich also left something to be desired. The meat was nice and tender though.\n\nOverall, Chrome Toaster was really meh. I hope they fair better this time than the last but, unless they step up their game, I really don't know how long they will last.","useful":3,"funny":1,"cool":1}

My date got the Pasta Marina with Mushrooms.  Lots of mushrooms.  After tasting her dish, I commented that I could probably make that same thing at home but better tasting.  \n\nWe each had two cocktails.  She had sangria and I had vodka \"iced tea\".  I didn't care for her drink.  It was overly sweet and syrupy.  However, I did like my Raspberry Vodka \"Iced Teas\" that were garnished with a blackberry and a lime.  I didn't even feel like drinking, but I am glad I ordered those.\n\nThe menu all fits on one page, but has a lot of variety and caters well to individuals with dietary restrictions.  We were impressed with the selection.\n\nHowever, the total bill was $90.  In my opinion, the food and the drinks were over-priced.  For a restaurant of its class located on East 4th Street, perhaps it is appropriately priced, but don't expect amazing food.  Expect food that tastes good, nothing more.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Since I was going in 2 days, all the rooms in Vegas were super expensive due to the Mayweather fight that weekend.  All the regular hotels were $100 ~ $125\/night for the older hotels (Luxor, Excalibur, etc), I decided to try this out.\n\nIt was about $90 with taxes included for a one night stay (which was discounted from the regular price of $150).  I thought originally this was going to be a hotel\/hostel place, since it was listed on hostelbookers but instead they were just renting out rooms using the hostelbookers website instead.  \n\nAfter checking in towards the early evening hours, there was no issue. The only requirement I told the staff at the registration desk was that I wanted a NON SMOKING room, I emphasized this a couple times before getting my room key.  The person said that it was non smoking for sure, so I proceed to the room (which was located in the same building as the registration desk).  \n\nWhen I got into the room, it smelled like cigarettes.  It was quite nasty, as I had a previous stay somewhere else where I got a smoking room, after sleeping there, the next morning, I smelled like cigarettes.\n\nI went back to the front desk to tell them that and they told me it was supposed to be a non smoking room and there was a sign clearly on the room door saying that.  Apparently, someone didn't really give a shit and smoked in there anyways.    I don't blame them, since they don't clean the rooms, they probably didn't know it smelled like that.  The cleaning staff should of done a better job cleaning it or converting that room into a smoking room. That was a mishap on that end.\n\nI managed to get the room exchanged to the adjacent building across the way, next to the parking lot.  This room was a lot better than first one.  It smelled like a regular room and it was clean.  One issue I had was that the bed lacked a thick enough blanket. It was quite thin and when you have the A\/C on, it gets cold after a while when your sleeping. \n\nAlso, the position of the ACs for each room is located in the hall as you walk towards your room.  If it's on, you get this stream of hot air blasting your feet before reaching your room.  Imagine having 10 units on at the same time (which was a bit warm that weekend), all this hot air coming at you after driving for 8+ hours. \n\nIn addition to  having the AC that low towards the wall, when you sleep, the AC is blasting right in your face.  It might be fine for some folks, but I prefer to have it higher up, so my face doesn't get blasted all night.  You can easily get sick from having it that way as well.  I don't think I'll be coming back to this place, it was pretty ghetto.  The price for this place should be more under $50 for what your getting.  I did enjoy the free ice though and the plentiful amount of parking in the back!","useful":2,"funny":2,"cool":1}

It's pretty much hidden inside the Four Seasons hotel.  I've never been to the Four Seasons for all the years I've been to Vegas.  I decided to look for a really good Sunday brunch place. After searching for an hour or so, I decided to go to Verandah.\n\nFinding parking without valet was a bit challenging at the Four Seasons.  I managed to find a huge parking lot that was south of the hotel.  I wasn't sure if it was for the Mandalay Bay beach resort or for the Four Seasons but I parked there anyways.  There didn't seem to have any signs at all what it was for.  If you drive towards the entrance of the Four Seasons, it's valet only.\n\nThe restaurant is located on the left after you go inside, past the PRESS cafe, which supposedly has really good cronuts.  When I got there on Sunday, it was already sold out, so I couldn't try it.\n\nI booked a reservation with opentable before coming to the restaurant.  The server was pretty attentive and got me seated within a few mins of arriving.  The place wasn't packed at all but had a decent amount of people.\n\nI seat outside, which was next to the pool area.  It was blocked off with some trees, so the patrons at the pool weren't bothersome.  After digging through the menu, I opted for the buffet brunch.  It was $40 with unlimited drinks, if you wanted Mimosas and such, you need to pay about $10 more.  \n\nAs I scoured through the food, everything looked good.  I tried almost everything and I had to say, it was good!  The scrambled eggs with salmon were perfect, not too much salt and had the perfect taste.  \n\nThe food varieties for the brunch ranged from banana pancakes, eggs benedicts to fresh made mini donuts (check the photo).

I am not nearly as conscious as I should be about what I eat.   Knowing there is an option to support a business that is helping even in the smallest way would definitely change my mind about where I might fulfill my fast food urges.  They are not using 100% organic and cruelty free but they are doing a whole lot more than most fast food places.

The reason I would guess is because it is situated right in downtown Guadalupe.  If you are not sure what Guadalupe is, it is a small community  founded by Yaqui Indians that incorporated their own town right in the middle of Tempe and Phoenix.  The town is now mainly Native American and Hispanic and is about one square mile in size.\n\nThe Farmer's Market has an amazing assortment of super fresh produce and they even make their own honey.  Right inside the door you can see some live bees hard at work making the delicious varieties.  Because this market is in an area with a lot of Hispanic residents they carry a large selection of Peppers fresh and dried.  They get a lot of their produce from local farmers and offer some organic choices.\n\nI know some people who are intimidated about going here because they fear the neighborhood it is in is 'different' than their stucco and chicken wire Stepford neighborhoods,  but I have never had a problem going here day or night.\n\nOne thing to be cautious of is the fact that this town's speed limit is 25 MPH everywhere and you better observe it.  For one thing there are a lot of dogs and people crossing the street all over the place so the slow speed is safest for everyone.  Also, Guadalupe has their own police and they will not hesitate to pull you over because you think 25 is just too slow.","useful":15,"funny":3,"cool":7}

Back east the thrift stores are not all clean and pretty like Savers or the giant Goodwills here in  AZ.  This place also doesn't have as high of prices as the clean and organized stores so you are more apt to find a bargain here.  \n\nGracie's is in an older building along Apache that always seems to have some water leaking and doesn't pipe in scents through the air system to mask the fact that you are buying someone else's old stuff. (I just realized that Goodwill does fragrance the air with cinnamon, I thought I was losing my mind until I noticed it in three separate Goodwills in the valley.)\n\nThey always have a lot of nice clothing, housewares and a lot of books.  I was in there recently and there seemed to be a lot less inventory so I don't know if they were just slow on donations or maybe clearing out to possibly renovate.  Getting to the place has been a nightmare recently because of the light rail construction so if you know your Tempe streets I would suggest coming in from the neighborhood behind the store, not off of Apache.\n\nGracie's is affiliated with Grace Community Church in Tempe and does have some religious literature near the front counter and has an abundance of Christian books for sale on their shelves.","useful":8,"funny":6,"cool":2}

Penzey's is wonderful if you like to cook.  Heck, it is wonderful if you just like interactive shopping.  Most of the available spices and herbs are set out in jars so that you may open the lid and give it a good sniff before purchasing.  You can tell a lot about a spice and how it will enhance your food just from one good smell.\n\nThe prices are beyond reasonable, the selection is great, and they even have their own spice mixes which are wonderful.  I recently picked up their \"Mural of Flavor\"  and it is so versatile, so tasty and contains NO salt.  As the previous reviewer stated, this place is wonderful for someone who is trying to use less salt in their food but does not want to give up any flavor.\n\nYou can get spices in small containers here, so you never have to worry about buying too much and having it go bad.  There are also plenty of extracts and goodies for bakers as well as many gift sets.\n\nIf you like fresh and inexpensive spices and herbs, Penzey's may be your new favorite store.","useful":4,"funny":1,"cool":3}

While we were not overly impressed with the amount of beer and wine to go (about 20 varieties of imported 6 packs and about 20 wines), we were impressed with the menu.   I really like Uncle Sals so I knew the food would be good, and it was right up the alley of my picky fiance.\n\nWe went here for Valentines day as we figured it would not be too packed, we were right.  They offer some nice wines by the glass and imported beers at a very reasonable price.  The menu consists of burgers, sandwiches, hot dogs (Vienna Beef), pizza, calzones and some sides.  The dessert menu is limited to blue bunny ice cream.  There is a small bar at the rear and about 10 tables.  It is very small and has a nice vibe.\n\nWe both ordered personal pizzas and they were very good.  The service was attentive and the food came promptly, even though Uncle Sals next door was PACKED.  I have only been here once to eat, but the first impression was very good.  I wish they would add a couple of salads to the menu as in the summer that is often all I am in the mood for.

Everyone was very hospitable and we were rendered excellent service. \n\nWe ordered: \nBakes ricotta and truffle honey- \nthis is a must order and always a winner!\nSteak Tartar with poached egg-\nYes, this time it came (we ordered it on the last visit and it never came, lol). This was seasoned perfectly and just the right amount of pickles, the egg made this dish extra rich and delicious. Make sure to ask for extra toast.\nMeatballs-\nThey were good, moist and tasty. The tart tomato sauce was a good compliment.\nTomato Bisque-\nthe bisque was tart and just a hint of sweetness. They served it with a cheese and salami sandwich to dip. Very good. \n\nMain Entrées \nShrimp Pasta-\nThis shrimp and pasta was topped with bread crumbs that gave it a great texture. The sauce was rich and pasta was cooked perfectly.\nHanger Steak-\nAnother great dish, cooked to temperature. We ordered rare. But the steak fries were a bit salty for our taste.\nWild Salmon-\nPoached then oven baked, moist and delicious. \nHamburger-\nWe order two and they both were cooked to temperature.

I recently moved in from New York City to  Arizona with a career opportunity. When I first arrived on the property I was greeted by Courtney Hunt who was extremely helpful. At the time I was searching for  Studio Apartments but all that was available was one bedroom Apartments. Courtney advised me to take the one bedroom and when a studio opens up I would be able to transfer to the studio. I signed the lease and moved my belongings into the apartment. As I entered and exit the property I was always greeted by the friendly staff members. I spend four weeks in the one bedroom until I was approached by Manager Hector Soto who had a Studio Apartment available for rent. I immediately accepted the offer and completed the paper work for the transfer. The following day Courtney handed me my keys to my Beautiful studio apartment that I currently live in. I have to commend  Courtney Hunt, Hector Soto, Jacqueline Rendon and Sarah Sanchez  they made my experience of Arizona unforgettable Thanks Again.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

You can add items to the pizza, but you could end up paying quite a bit for a 12\" pizza, depending on what you add of course. Extra items start at $1 and then go up from there. The menu also consists of salads and appetizers to go along with the pizzas. They have a comfortable dining area with bench style seats, chairs, and booths that are set around wood tables. It is a Rustic decor that goes along with the menu.\n\nWe ordered a couple of salads. The Romana Salad and the Beet Salad. Both salads were okay. The arugula was fresh. The beet salad had red and yellow beets. They beets tasted like they were from a can. There was very little cheese on both salads.\n\nWe ordered three pizzas and added some items on each pizza. I know now that this type of pizza is known for being a bit soggy towards the middle of the dough after reading about it. I'm not a fan of soggy pizza.\n\nQuattro Formaggi Pizza.

I added mushrooms, peppers, and onions. This pizza was cooked slightly less than the Quattro and was also soggy in the middle.\n\nMargherita Pizza. I added olives, mushrooms, and artichoke. This pizza dough was under cooked and not at all crispy.\n\nThe cooking of the pizzas were very inconsistent. We had three pizzas for one table that were all cooked for different amounts of time, unless their oven was not distributing the heat properly.\n\nThe service was excellent. The waitress was very nice. I'm going to cut the pizza maker some slack this time. Their air conditioner was broken and he was cooking by a 900 degree oven.

They were very fresh tasting, but they were gulf coast oysters and I was not aware that they also had cold water oysters available. I would have rather had the cold water oysters, but I did not find out until after dinner when I was talking to the cook. The server should let you know that you have a choice of oysters from different regions when you are ordering. We also ordered the steamed mussels, which came with the standard butter and lemon sauce. The mussels were also very fresh tasting.\n\nI ordered the fish & chips for my entree. They use tempura as their batter for the cod. You get two pieces with fries and cole slaw. The fish was pretty good. Was not greasy at all. The cole slaw comes with roasted corn and bacon mixed in it. I don't eat pork, so one of the cooks mixed me some fresh slaw with just the roasted corn and no bacon. That was nice of him.\n\nThe service was very good overall. I would say excellent, but they forgot our bread basket. It was also very slow when I was there, so I can't say how good or bad the service is when it is busy.\n\nI will definitely be back and I would recommend that you give it a try. The total bill was $72.00 for a dozen oysters, a dozen steamed mussels, 2 orders of fish & chips, one Blue Moon. and one soda.","useful":8,"funny":1,"cool":4}

The burgers are definitely not up to par with the likes of LBS, Bacchi Burger, and Gordon Ramsay Burger.

It was on a Tuesday morning, so there was not much of a crowd. Be ready for all the construction if you go during the day. They are still constructing a theater directly across from the park.\n\nWe tried the original Chicken & Waffle sandwich and the Roasted Mushroom & Grilled Chicken Salad. Both were excellent.\n\nYou walk in and you order at a counter, as you would at any fast food establishment. Once you order you are given a pager that will vibrate when your order is ready. The server brings your food to you. The servers looked like they were having trouble finding the customers when their orders were ready. They might want to fine tune the order delivery system. I would suggest having the customers pick up their order when the pager is activated.\n\nThe salad was very good. It had roasted crimini mushrooms, grilled chicken breast, sun-dried tomatoes, goat cheese, romaine, and arugula. The dressing was a lemon and balsamic vinaigrette.\n\nThe waffle was very light and crispy and it was folded in half with a good sized piece of fried boneless chicken breast on top of cider slaw. The chicken was seasoned well and I think I liked it with the slaw instead of with syrup. It was a nice change from the sweet syrup you usually get on chicken and waffles. Very tasty!!!\n\nI will definitely be back if I am in the area. I recommend you stop in. You won't be disappointed.","useful":10,"funny":5,"cool":9}

I don't care for all of the toppings.\n\n1 - Chicken Dog - the chicken apple sausage dog was good, but I should not have told them to top it like the Chicago dog.\n\n1 - Crinkle Fries - good fries.\n\nI like the fact that the chicken served here is free range and all of the meat is natural (No hormones and no anti-biotics).

First of all, there are 2 types of chicken: fried and citrus grilled. The fried is by far the most popular and it is made in abundance. The grilled seems to be a rare commodity because when we ordered it they said it would take 20 minutes. It ended up taking 30 minutes to get any of our food, so unhappy face for that one.\n\nThree registers but only one being used to take orders, hence the line is out the door. Unhappy face #2.\n\nPlace is rather chaotic and disorganized. Worse yet, the floor was covered in grease - you could practically slide on it. Pretty gross.\n\nDespite all of this, the food is still worth trying, but I recommend being selective. The grilled chicken is quite good, juicy, and was enjoyed by all. Adding a squeeze of extra lime kicks it up another notch. Thumbs up on fried bananas and the bread. I would not bother with the rice or cole slaw - both are forgettable. \n\nBottom line: Best bet is to just order chicken only and use the drive through. Serve it at home with your own rice and other goodies and you'll be happy. Probably worth trying the fried chicken and the empanadas.

It looked like it had easy enough access for me, so I decided to check it out.  I was craving a healthy-but-salty (oxymoron, right?) salad but changed my mind when I checked out the menu.\n\nIt's an average sized place with a counter that you walk up to and order from.  You pay, sit, and they bring your food to you.  It is BYO which is nice but not traditional as the place doesn't really seem to \"fit\" a BYO restaurant in the vibe or menu (it's a deli essentially).\n\nI ordered the white cheddar mac and cheese because it had an entire section on the menu for it so I figured it would be good.  I also ordered the Motmot wrap which had turkey, bacon, some tomato aioli.   I also got a foundtain drink.  It ended up at about $15 which seemed a little high for a lunch.\n\nThe service was quick which is nice for a workday lunch.  \n\nThe (side order) of mac and cheese?  It was really good and could be a meal in itself.  The bowl was put under a broiler to make it a little crispy.  The noodles were slightly overcooked which I do not prefer in  mac and cheese but the star of the dish was, of course, the cheese.  Thick cheese sauce that I knew was hearty after three bites.  Very cheddary--not too sharp.  It was more like a glue than a sauce.\n\nThe wrap came with chips and was served warm which I was not expecting.  Too much aioli--this is common at restaurants anywhere, but I don't think a sandwhich needs to be dripping in dressing, especially since this was nothing special.  The turkey was nice and thinly sliced.  The bacon felt more like bacon bits than chopped bacon or even slices of bacon.  The turkey was fresh.  I only had a few chips.  I couldn't tell if they were house made or otherwise.  \n\nI went back after my three bites of mac and cheese for more.  Outside of the noodles being overcooked, that dish is really something special.  \n\nI would go back to try something else, just not a wrap because I think for the cost it's lacking in execution and flavor.","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":1}

I won a marathon entry and found myself in the middle of the third coldest February in Pittsburgh history--figures.  I went in looking for some running inspiration and maybe some warmer layers and I had another really good interaction with a staff member there.  They helped with picking what has turned into my favorite running pant (after trying at least three from other stores) and it was a good, genuine interaction.\n\nI am happy to say my return visits continue to be positive.

I was a little disappointed with that.  They give three tortillas (not house made) which... was kind of disappointing.

I have been here once a week since they have opened and have been really happy each time.  Maybe it's the mood boost from all the vitamins being absorbed into my blood stream, who knows.  \n\nFirst off, thank goodness for Eat N Park and their corporate capital to bring a much-needed juicery into downtown Pittsburgh.  I think it's great.  I hope they do well.  The manager of the store and the employees are still going through their learning curve but I don't think it's unreasonable to expect that to last (per Justine's review).  They are less than a month old.  \n\nI've had the acai bowl as she spoke of and it was sweet--it's fruit based.  I guess I was not \"shoked\" by this...  It wasn't sweet like saccrine (ha!), or sweet from added sugar, but sweet from the fruit going into it.   They list each ingredient that goes into the smoothie, juice, or bowl.  I appreciated that.  I've tried their vegan protein and I was okay--it's plant based and not as forumlated as others.  It wasn't overly chalky.  \n\nI've had the green juice and I love it.  They don't serve it super foamy like other places which I appreciate because I hate getting a cup of juice with 1\/3 of it being foam.  Not cool.  \n\nThe only thing I would complain about it the price-to-juice ratio.  At the other juice bars around town you get a larger size juice\/smoothie for the same price that you spend at Delicious Raw.  I don't think this will distract me from buying here because when I want a juice downtown, I'm happy to even have an option.  Staff is friendly, menu has options, in general I like this place.  If they could figure out a way to make the pricing more competitive I think they will grow more followers.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I went on a weekday morning so that I could actually get a seat and have the food at it's prime--not cooked in a hurry to see how the food really was.  Well, that was also the only time I had, as well.\n\nI was greeted quickly and seated and given a nice cup of coffee.  They did an exceptional job of keeping the coffee mugs full (another reason  to go on a weekday) and it was good coffee.  \n\nI had to try the hot cakes, but didn't want to OD on carbohydrates so I got the Egg Combo with the speciality hotcakes.  The waitress recommended the banana oatmeal or the apple cinnamon.  I went with the banana oatmeal.  Two over easy eggs and bacon, though they offer sausage patties or links in both regular (sage) and hot.\n\nMy food came quickly and I was disappointed to find the eggs sharing the plate with the hotcakes.  I like my food separated and dippy eggs leave a residue that sometimes can't be mopped up with bacon.  I guess I would have preferred a plate with the eggs\/bacon and a plate with the hotcakes.  \n\nThe eggs were cooked perfectly as was the bacon.  Crispy yet chewy.  I have to eat my eggs and bacon before I can eat my hotcakes, because, again, I don't like my food touching--especially something sweet and savory.  \n\nLet's talk about the hotcakes.  They were served with a big dollop of whipped butter which I loved.  Whipped butter spreads pretty easy.  I like that.  I'm picky.  Especially with breakfast.  There were slices of banana cooked in which I also liked.  They tasted like a diabetics worst\/best nightmare.  They were sweet and fork tender like a nice pancake should be.  They would have been fine without syrup.  When I added syrup it felt like I was eating a slightly sweeter version of banana bread.  I wanted to stop at one.  I really did.  I really really did.  I was getting full.  I can stop eating food that isn't good without much of a problem.  I had a problem with that second hotcake\n\nMy other \"complaint\" is that is is rather expensive for a small diner.  I paid a little over $10 for my breakfast.  For $10, I would have preferred a more generous portion of bacon, at least.  My idea of pricing is a bit off, I guess, mainly because I live in an area outside of Pittsburgh that is a lot less expensive.  \n\nSo, I will go back, for sure.  The breakfast is GOOD and I think most places that attempt to serve breakfast should be GOOD.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

This came after years of searching for someone I trusted with my hair.  \n\nI found Salon Bernabo because they use the Davine's line of hair color and shampoo.  For anyone that's interested (obsessed?) with hair color and natural products I would recommend this particular line.  It's not the generic Wella, etc brands that you find in ever other salon.  It's better, sustainable, etc.  Needless to say, these products aren't available at ever salon and the Pittsburgh area only has three salons that offer Davines.  \n\nIf you're looking for a super-posh, super trendy salon, you're better off going to Shadyside.  If you're looking for superior skill, attentiveness, high quality, I would definately try Salon Bernabo.  I see the same stylist each time, but the cuts I see leaving from the other stylists are top notch.\n\nNext comes the ability of the stylist to provide some guidance on \"what to do\" with your hair.  I really love that I have a stylist that is able to guide me when some of my ideas won't work but provide me change.

Little did I know this store would help me find great quality cuts of meat (try the bacon from the meat counter when they have it!), fresh breads, artisan cheeses, great quality coffee.  I was smitten.  It was through this store I developed my love of cooking.  Time (and work) took me away from Pittsburgh for a few years but now I am back.\n\nA lot can be said about the Whole Paycheck stores popping up around Pittsburgh as well as the butchers in the East End (I will never go there) that have become trendy since I've left.

McGinnis Sisters is one of them.\n\nI recently visited my trusted store and had a sub-par experience with a cut of pork.  I wasn't sure what to do, honestly, as I never expected to have this experience...  I emailed them to let them know of a wonky butcher experience (his description of the product was less than steller) as well as my cut of pork shoulder.  Wow.  I could not be more impressed with their customer service and dedication to their product.  They aren't just selling product, they BELIEVE in their product.  They offered to replace the pork shoulder and to work with their Meat Department manager to make it right.  \n\nWhen I returned to the store, the wonky butcher was there (this time he coughed into his glove and I'm pretty sure he didn't change it) but the other guys behind the counter were SO QUICK to help me.  I brought in the leftover pork and they replaced it, no questions asked.  I really do love McGinnis Sister's and try to talk them up whenever possible.  I love that they carry milk from Brunton Dairy.  I love their fresh bread (I got both on this second trip) and their seafood is still as fresh as I remember.

For me, it is within walking distance for basics and staples and does stock fresh produce.  In addition, I am aware of some level of \"investment\" in the building itself so the appearance is nice.\n\nCons:  I have shopped here twice.  Since Foodland doesn't dominate the grocery \"market\" in Pittsburgh, I do think their prices are a little high.  The two times I was there I was looking for a particular item.  The first was a can opener.  They sell them, but it was not in stock.  That was frustrating.  I've heard this complaint about this store other times, too.  The second trip I was looking for very particular items: hummus and pita.  Now, I realize hummus is not a total staple in the American (aka Western PA) diet, but I would have thought there'd be some demand considering the economic make-up of the Mount.  They had hummus.  Yes.  But after not being able to find it, asking a clerk, and searching, I found only one type of hummus.  The next item, pita, was also in a very bizarre place and I almost had to settle on pita chips (which they had a ton of) before two clerks located the last of the fresh pita.\n\nIn all, I will fully support the Foodland in Mt. Washington and re-review after they make some changes.  Until then, I will be forced to use it only for staples which is a shame.  The staff working there are very helpful, despite the stocking and layout issues it seems to have.\n\nUPDATE: I changed from a 3-star to a 1-star because I recently went in, asked an employee for help, and he looked at me and told me to ask someone else working.

It used to be served in this cast-iron pie dish.  Not anymore. Instead, this gummy, undercooked (COLD) garlic bread arrived at the table.  I guess cold is the theme for the meal.  The house salad did fine but was sort of not impressive enough to distract from the cold bread.  Wine was served.  And drank.  And drank.  Because it took our food FOREVER to come.  We ordered the traditional Thanksgiving meal for 10 and a large side of pasta (when in Rome).\n\nAfter our meal arrived, we dug in.  Turkey Breast (so SO DRY) on top of stuffing (which most folks liked) both were COLD.  Mashed potatoes (those were pretty good, but cold.. If they weren't cold, I would have had seconds).

Everything about it is top notch.  If you are a novice and looking to get into indoor cycling as your choice of exercise, or even advanced and looking to take it to the next level, this place is for you.  \n\nFirst, the feel of the studio is very spa-like and soothing.  I love that about the place.  It's clean and well kept.  I really desire that in a studio as if I am going to pay above a healthclub price, I think that is an important detail.  The towels smell amazing!!  That is an important detail especially because get ready to sweat!  If you're going to be wiping sweat off your face, its always nice with something that smells good!\n\nI love the bikes.  They are \"real life\" bikes that move with you unlike a traditional stationary indoor cycling bike.  You engage your core and arms to keep yourself steady.  And don't worry, you won't fall off.  If there was ever a client to do that, it would have been me!  \n\nThe instructors are challenging and motivating and I really enjoyed the workout that I had.  I cannot wait to go back to take advantage of the yoga offerings.  I loved that a lot of folks took the cycling class then the yoga right after--two very complimentary classes back to back.  \n\nI honestly have nothing bad to say and it makes me sad that I didn't choose to move to the North Side when I moved back to Pittsburgh as I would LOVE to have this place as my primary studio.

Let's see why.....\n\nI attempt to drive to Whole Foods only to be caught in a line of 5-6 cars attempting to get into the parking lot.  (I guess I'm not cool enough to ride Pat Transit from the South Pittsburgh home).  When I find a place to park, after the Lexus SUV (HA!) pulls out, I find that they didn't put their cart back.  \n\nSo I enter the store and admire how their design is very appealing to the eyes (how DO organic oranges get so ROUND and so ORANGE) and everything is stacked so neatly.  Then I read that a pound of these oranges are $1.99...  Then I go to the meat section, which I don't even eat, to find that the prices are double those of Trader Joe's or even Market District (see future review).  So I walk around and debate to see if I should buy Clif Bars and Naked Juice (which happens to be on sale) because LORD KNOWS I don't need bulk-blanched-almonds.  But then I decide to buy \"fresh\" CHUNKY peanut butter because it would be fun to try.  (When I get home later, however, I bought Valencia peanut butter, whatever the hell that is, and cannot stomach it.  Gimmie my Jif.)  So while I am waiting in line, I see the  bikes (those rebellious urbanites moved from Quiet Storm) and wonder if my money is better spent elsewhere.  \n\nRegardless, I whole-heartedly (no pun intended) support organic and sustainable farming, but I'd rather go to the farmer's market or drive a bit further out of the city to go somewhere real to buy my \"whole food\".

Who knew there would be so many options for indoor cycling in the South Hills?  It's been cool to watch them grow from a small studio in Dormont (when my Cousin first started going & was obsessed & recommended I try), to a larger space in Castle Shannon, to a second studio in Beaver County.  I -WISH- they were in Beaver when I lived there, because I had to drive all the way to Cranberry!  \n\nI've taken part in their 90 minute classes, their 45 minute classes, and their 60 minute classes.  I've had three different instructors including the owner.  LOVE taking the owners class.  I did feel called-out when another instructor said folks that go over on RPMs aren't working hard enough (my suggestion would be to coach differently and say \"hey, just a reminder to the class to stay within this RPM range\" ... heck, there could be some strong cyclists in the class as well!).  The atmosphere is very club-like and the DJ and videos make the class fly by.  I really enjoy that because it can feel monotonous after awhile (it is a stationary bike afterall!)\n\nHonestly, what sealed the deal (and if it weren't for the aggressive coaching style they would get 5 stars but I feel like that's really important) was the customer service!  I bought a new pair of cycling shoes there (my old ones bit the dust after 10 years) and I noticed they had a crack in them three days after I got them!  The bearded guy at the front desk was SO nice and replaced them with a better pair, no questions asked.  I could not have been happier until he gave me a free wrench for future clip adjustment!  Ahh!  Perfect.  Honestly, I was blown away.  I think those of us that are avid cyclists know how annoying it is when a clip comes loose and to have that to keep in my gym bag is perfect!  A+ on that for sure.  \n\nFinally, I think the culture of this place is really important.  I don't feel the need to wear high-end athletic wear to fit in unlike some other gyms and the instructors don't come around and add resistance (yes, that's happened to me and yes I never went back).  All in all, a very positive experience here!","useful":0,"funny":1,"cool":0}

After a very (very) bad groupon experience, I decided to try the place down the road.  Total bonus: they offered 50% off the service the first time (and you leave with samples as a new client!).  The good:  it really was NOT as painful as my last skin-wrenching experience (see other review).  The woman applying the wax was very thorough with hair removal.  Their \"system\" is to apply wax in two areas, work on one while the other cures, which is supposed to save time.  The woman who did my wax was very personable, but I think you need to be to do those types of services.\n\nWaxing itself was very positive.  It was relatively fast.  \n\nThe only thing I would complain about is the amount of residue left after the wax, which felt excessive.  I definitely think some more time could have been spent cleaning up but I will give them a pass since it was a discounted service.\n\nThe cool thing about this place is they have a pretty nice discounted \"subscription\" service that I may take advantage of if I don't find my 5-star waxing salon soon.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

More on that later.\n\nI've had a multitude of items here.  The shining items are the solar-ray shot, the green anna bread smoothie (it tastes like banana bread), the Redhead Irish Juice (one of my favorites), and the Beet Goes On juice.  They had a Pecan Pie smoothie in the fall that was really really good.  The Racer's Edge Smoothie didn't taste like anything to me.  The Brain On shot that I got...I felt I was shorted.  There was probably 1\/2 ounce in the glass when I paid for a 1 ounce shot.  The kid working asked his coworker if they had more of the second ingredient in the shot...  I definately think I was shorted there.  \n\nThe staff is friendly enough.  It seems they prefer to talk to the Sewickley parents more than anything which is fine.  I like that they added the option off adding \"extras\" to the smoothies--kale, spinach, alge.  \n\nMy main complaint is their punch-card system.  It took me three separate visits to ask if I had a punch card.  They have a punch card where, after 12 punches, you earn a free menu item.  Along the way, you earn free health shots (after punch 4 and punch 8).  I like that aspect of the punch card especially given the price point of the place.  \n\nThe problem is this--one day I stopped in and ordered a smoothie for myself and a smoothie for my sister (who was with me).  The girl working only punched my card once.  She got pretty short with me and said \"it's per transaction\".  Interesting... definately is not stated on the card, so I asked her to break up the purchases into two transactions.  She continued to be short and said \"It's per transaction per visit\".... Interesting definately not stated on the card, but punched my card for the second time.  If it were a free coffee card where the value of the coffees and punches were around $2, I would not really be concerned with this but if you consider that you could be buying a smoothie each time you are in and ultimately have to buy 12--after your 12th visit you get \"Free Menu Item\" then there is some value there.  The scenario changes when you present your punch card and if you buy more than one item, you only get one punch, the value of what they are providing you \"for free\" greatly lessens.  I guess my point is, if they are going to put restrictions on how they are going to use the card, then they ought to be explicit on the card.  Their website also has no information on the program so there is no way to know.    But perhaps that why I wasn't offered one the first three times I went into the store and why no one mentions it?","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0}

Unique flavors\/fusions.  Something fun and different.  I totally get it.  A lot of people will pay $3 for something like that and be really happy.\n\nI got the pineapple basil.  Two very good flavors on their own.  We picked them up from the Downtown Farmer's Market on a hot summer day.  I was pretty underwhelmed with my popsicle.  The cost for two popsicles is $6.  I could make several at home at that price.  It felt as though the pineapple was not pureed enough.  I enjoyed the flecks of basil, but overall the citrus of the pineapple was not strong prominent enough.  It was like a frozen chunky stick.\n\nThe honeydew pistachio was also very underwhelming.  Honeydew is such a light flavor that it probably should have been left on it's own.  The pistachio (which should be chunky! from the chopped nuts) overpowered the melon.  Just not good.

He even stated that it was fine but continued to give a suspicious look. Now I have a job where I look at Id's all day long, some people don't photo well but she looked the exact same on her id as she did sitting there. After that he demanded a credit card to start a tab, since we were in a hurry we just asked to pay for it now so that we could leave when we were finished and when we put down cash it just seemed like it wasn't good enough for him.

We already had our venue for our reception (in downtown also), and we wanted to get a cool hotel for us to stay at that was close. It was between the new Sheraton or the Wyndham, the Sheraton is a very nice hotel also but WAY too overpriced. \n\nWe decided to take a shot in the dark and see if we could get a group rate so that anyone coming from out of town could book a room at a discounted rate. We got in touch with someone there and were able to give us $99 rooms with the wedding couple (us) getting a jr suite for the same price. \n\nThe people there were super friendly and helpful, they even let us take a tour of the room to see what they were like. They were also very accommodating, they even delivered gift bags for us. \n\nI read a lot of the reviews about the hotel and didn't have any of the problems that they did. Yes the halls aren't updated yet like the rooms, but they aren't gross, just a little outdated, and I'm sure they are still working on it. I didn't hear any noise from any other rooms. They only problem I had was that when I left my room, the door would slam shut and THAT was really loud, it didn't bother me but just made me feel bad in case I woke somebody up with it. \n\nOverall it was really cool to stay in this hotel, it made it an even better night for everyone I think they all like the hotel.","useful":0,"funny":0,"cool":0}

We tried to use it today and they waited until the middle of the massage to tell us that the gift certificate expires after 6 months. (Isn't that illegal?) They then told us that it's because they have new owners and have to pay the workers. Never once did we see anything saying they are under new management. So instead of paying $50 for a massage, we ultimately paid $100.","useful":3,"funny":0,"cool":0}

I even offered for them to take some of the people who walked in and we could wait because it was my birthday and I had all day. My boyfriend arrived within the next 5 minutes and we were both rushed through our pedicure. We were not offered different options even though I could clearly see a \"menu\" in their bucket to pick from. I thought maybe they just didn't yes their menu, but then I saw them offer it to a lady right next to me.

Dennis proved me wrong in the first 10 minutes of meeting him. I had never seen my dog be so attentive before. After just 3 sessions, my dog has made insane amounts of progress. Typically, my dog cannot be around other people or dogs as she acts very aggressive. Her bark is so loud and alarming that people typically RUN the other direction when they hear her. We were having to plan walks around when we wouldn't run into anyone. I just got back from a walk with her now and my mind is blown. The leash was slack the entire time, she sat whenever I stopped walking, and she even politely greeted another dog\/dog owner on the way!

My husband had the Ravioli Caprese, Stuffed with Ricotta Cheese, San Marzano Cherry Tomatoes, Fresh Basil Sauce. Both the Steak and Ravioli had the most delicious tiny tiny cherry tomatoes pan sauteed on the top of them.   Other family had the Lasagna and the Fettuccine which were both very Italian and Very delicious. For Dessert I had the Pannacotta which was topped with a Bruleed Slice of Orange ( incredible ) and Blueberries!  Everyone enjoyed their dinner immensely.

We were seated and the concept was explained to those who had not been at this kind of venue before. The salad bar is quite amazing..but here is the deal..you would think they would want youto fill up on the bar so that the meat would not be calling your name quite so many times..But I am an advocate of food not mixing ( no chinese buffets for me) and pooling together on the plate..and part of this was my fault because I could have flipped my token over so they would stop laying the meat all over my glorious Gorganzola Mousse . But they immediatley come and start asking you if you want --Garlic Beef, Parm Pork, Bacon Wrapped Chicken and of course the eater in me was like YES!  So then I slowed it down..asked for a clean plate..but alas I did lose a lot of the things that I took from the salad bar and I could have returned ..but by then I had already added 4 or 5 lbs to my body and it was hard to walk in high heels!!\nWe brought our own wine..it was a 30th Birthday for my daughter and we knew \"Our Family\" so we needed wine..we tried to make a little deal with our Captain..not to charge 20 bucks corking fee for every bottle and we would tip him more..but  no go...so we had 6 bottles at 20 bucks a pop..Kind of steep..Then we brought in a homemade cake that I had made for my daughter, her request a Black Forest Torte and I had the candles and the plates and the knife to cut it with..they said they would serve it ...at 2 bucks a plate...So we let them sing to us and rejected the cake cutting charge. This is not a cheap place..it is expensive and they add a 18% tip to every bill without mentioning it and some of the people didnt know it and added more...so ...I am saying that it has the good Brazilian steak house attitude but a few hidden charges..and I know had we ordered the wine we would have paid more than 20 bucks a bottle..but   I feel like they could have worked with us a little..we had 14 people..they made a lot of moula off of us....Will I go back..Yes ... and  now I know which of the meats to eat and which to hold off on..Thanks for your ear!","useful":4,"funny":2,"cool":1}

This started with Fried Oysters that were for sure fried a couple of days ago and then reheated in a microwave! ..Fried Green tomatoes were straight out of frozen bag and not fried..just barely baked..still cold in the middle..very bland. The New Orleans style Barbequed Shrimp....tiny little salad size and in the same sauce that everything including the gumbo had. \nI am going to spare you anymore..but to tell you It will for sure be another 10 years before I go back...thank goodness the company was fantastic!!","useful":1,"funny":0,"cool":0}

We sat in line for around 15 minutes, but it was fine we were looking at the menu online. But Alas when we got to the order microphone we were unhappy to hear that not one of the \"8\" items they mentioned online did they have. They were supposed to have a Veggie Burger and a Vegetarian Melt. Nope....they had Cheese Fries they said, that's  all. So we had no choice but to order the cheese fries, and we ordered a couple of sandwiches. The cheese fries were just the small order of fries with some Cheese Whiz stuff on them, not hot but cool. I ordered a Frisco Burger which was two white pieces of bread with a couple of paper thin patties on them and a sauce that was like a tomato mayonnaise, the amount of grease was intense. The bread was suppose to be sourdough and thick but it was not. My husband got a Portobello and Swiss burger, his was probably the best, but also almost 7 dollars. I realize this is NOT a vegetarian place but usually in todays society with so many people opting out of red meat you would think they would have had an option, like they described online.

We started out with an extra appetizer which was the Truffle Pommes , yes french fries with truffle salt and a house made ailoi which was delicous! We then varied which item  each of us ordered ( party of two ) so we could taste all the different items. We loved the Pasta  Alla Chitarra which was duck egg Carbonara, it was a nice size portion and the flavor was spot on! The Jerusalem Artichoke Parsnip Bisque was heavenly. One of the Unique things we recieved was a Salt tray, it was served with our Entree, which had Four different sea salts and each was a flavor explosion in your mouth! Really loved that! I got the Filet with Crispy Asparagus and My daughter got the Swordfish with Meyer Lemon and olives and salsify We topped off this dinner with their Salted Caramel Budino which was a wonderful rendition of one of my favorite desserts with homemade almond cookies on the side.

I decided to try The New Tony Saccos over at the Promenade. They do not deliver so I knew that I would have to go pick it up. I called and the website does have a download menu but there are no prices on it. I relayed my order which was for two 16 inch pies and one 12 inch pie- and a order of Rotoli's . I asked the girl for the total, she said \"I have no idea - but the bartender will tell you when you pick it up\"??? They told me 20 minutes, I live very close and got there in less than 15. It was very crowded, the bartender was looking for my order which they were just boxing up. He took my credit card and said...62.47!! Holy Mozzerella Batman!  That seemed like a awful lot-but me being a Pizza Snob..thought..its gonna be fantastic! I will pay anything for REALLY GOOD FOOD, so I took my boxes and left. \nWe opened the first 16 inch it was to be a \"White Pizza (no red sauce) with Bacon and Italian finger peppers. It was White, it had Jalapenos on it and Sausage. BOOOOO then the second 16 inch was a Pepperoni and Sausage, also with Italian finger peppers which were also just Jalapenos -  very few pieces of pepperoni or sausage. The third was a TRADITIONAL 12 inch, just cheese and red sauce. Well--they were all limp, crust was not good, not at all..I am very surprised it is advertised as a wood burning oven - I did not smell it when I came into the restaurant, nor taste it on the Pizza. The White sauce was okay, of course no bacon which is what my guest wanted and very few little piles of sausage - although the sausage was decent,  in a Southern world where most sausage is cut from a hard italian sausage this was loose meat. The two other pizza's were just  meh...nothing..and the Garlic Rotolis were dry and gross..a big hunk of pizza dough  twisted and baked without seasoning and served with a small salad dressing container of garlic oil and vinegar. I will not be returning to Tony's...I should have taken my friends advice and tried the new Pizza Place at Stonecrest called \"TRUE\" --she is from New York and knows good Pizza..
